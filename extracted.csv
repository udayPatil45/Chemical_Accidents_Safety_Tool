Explosion in furnace,Process (Crude Distillation) unit in refinery,15/10/2024,"CASE STUDY OISD/CS/2024-25/P&E/12 Dt.:15/10/2024 INTRODUCTION Title: Explosion in furnace. Location: Process (Crude Distillation) unit in refinery. Loss/ Outcome: Damage of equipment, property, unit outage & production loss. BRIEF OF INCIDENT: Unit had resumed operation after M&I (Maintenance and Inspection) shutdown of 22 days. Startup and feed cut was done around 6 days before the incident that occurred at about the end of the night shift (early morning hours). Certain areas of the refinery including the unit were inundated in around 1 to 2 feet water due to heavy rainfall since afternoon. The unit was running at 450 m3/hr, at 73% of capacity. Around 2:30 hrs in the night shift, panel operator observed that the control valve supplying fuel gas to the Furnace along with a few other valves opening had clamped at the last opening. The shift-in-charge subsequently informed the concerned Instrument Manager for necessary corrective action. The instrument technician reached the instrument rack room at around 05:30 hrs. After analysing the problem, he reset the analogue control card of the controller. Consequently, the control valves connected to the card went into their fail-safe position inclusive of the Fuel Gas control valve, which closed completely (“Fail-Safe- Position”) on its own, overwriting the value fed in DCS. Panel operator noticed the closed position of the fuel gas control valve after about 6-minutes. The panel operator re-opened the fuel gas control valve manually from Distributed Control System (DCS) panel. Around 3 minutes later, explosion occurred in the furnace with momentary fire. Consequently, the shell of the furnace burst open. . This Case Study is based on the Investigation report done by OISD and published for information purpose only. This information should be evaluated to determine if it is applicable in your operations, to avoid recurrence of such incidents.OBSERVATIONS / LAPSES • The furnace shell had split from around 1 m about the burner floor to the furnace arch level. Furnace tubes were also uprooted from hangers. Some piping, electrical cables & trays, instrument & cables and insulation lining (blanket) inside furnace were damaged. • Night shift panel operator was operating unit from 2019. He was in the unit as field operator since 2009. Panel operator assessment (before assuming panel charge) record was available, however no subsequent refresher training record were found. • As per DCS trend, earlier in the morning shift of the day, the furnace excess oxygen reading was between 3 to 4%. However, after 15.20 hrs excess oxygen was in the range of 0.2 to 0.1 % till plant emergency shutdown. Furnace was balanced draft furnace. Although the excess oxygen could be adjusted from panel, action was neither taken by the evening, nor the night shift panel operator to increase combustion air flow. Normally the amount of excess air in the furnace is kept at 2-3% to ensure complete combustion. • Due to unavailability of fuel gas (as other units, which were fuel gas generators, were under shutdown.), vaporised LPG was being used as fuel gas for furnace as per standard industrial practice. According to LPG lab report, 40.5% was propane and 58.6% butane, with rest consisting of heavier hydrocarbons. • DCS analogue card failure alarm of fuel gas control valve appeared on instrument console as well as MCR operator console at 01:32 and 01:51 hrs in the night shift; however, it was not noticed. • Any work permit related to the analogue control card rectification job could not be furnished. This was in violation of Cl. 7.3 of OISD-GDN-206 (Safe Work Practises) and organization’s instrument SOP for “Online Replacement of Redundant DCS/PLC. • The panel operator opened the control valve of fuel gas to furnace manually from panel, without following furnace start up procedure, i.e., purging for a defined duration, etc. This was also in deviation to the requirements of Cl. 9.2 of OISD-STD-111. • Burner Management system (BMS) was not available in the furnace (16-F-01) as the furnace was an old one, commissioned in 1998. There was no “pilot on” indication available. Hence, the panel operator could not have ascertained that whether the flame was on in furnace or had extinguished when the fuel gas valves had closed. • As per DCS record, FG supply control valve was opened from 0 to 50% (i.e., 2359 Kg/ hr) in about 3 mins. Considering the control valve flow characteristics, around 155 Kg LPG was supplied to furnace box. • As per Sequence of Event (SOE) record (the alarm register of PLC), following interlocks related to the furnace (16-F-01) were bypassed since start of unit after M&I: ➢ Lo-Lo Pilot Gas Pressure ➢ Lo-Lo Fuel Gas Pressure ➢ Hi-Hi Arch Pressure The bypass was done from DCS console without approval in non-compliance of approved Interlock Bypass procedure. • Before explosion, Lo-Lo Fuel gas header pressure and Hi-Hi Arch pressure switch actuated. However, since the interlock was bypassed, shutdown was not triggered. • At the time of incident furnace box temperature was above the LPG auto ignition temperature. • Furnace stack damper physical opening could not be verified because of non-availability of stack positioner at grade level. This was a non-compliance of requirements of Cl. 5.4 of OISD-STD- 111. Two numbers of OWS funnel were found within 10 meters of furnace. This was a non- compliance of requirements of Cl. 4.1 of OISD-STD-111. • Organization had developed a detailed plan named “Managing Exigency During Heavy Rain” with responsibility matrix. As per Action plan, in case of cyclonic alert/ heavy rain/water flooding, various action had been identified like safe shutdown to be initiated if equipment submerged in This Case Study is based on the Investigation report done by OISD and published for information purpose only. This information should be evaluated to determine if it is applicable in your operations, to avoid recurrence of such incidents.water or activate steam load shedding, etc. However, unit was running even after being flooded. No evidence of deliberation/ discussion/ meeting/ instruction to continue the plant operation was available. CONCLUSION / ROOT CAUSE The resetting of the fuel gas supply to furnace control valve analogue control card resulted in closure of the valve. Hence, the flame of the burners must have extinguished. Subsequently, when the panel operator opened the fuel gas controller manually, without following the procedure of purging the furnace before relighting it, the un-combusted gas got ignited on coming in contact with the already hot tubes and detonated. RECOMMENDATIONS • In case of flame failure/ failure of Fuel Gas/ Fuel Oil, furnace light up procedure i.e., box purging, pilot burner light up, main burner light up etc. shall be followed in line with Cl. 11.3 of OISD-STD- 111. • Lapses in compliance with the work permit system, interlock bypass procedure, SOP for “Managing Exigency During Heavy Rain” to be investigated and necessary corrective action to be taken for strict compliance in future. • Installation of Burner Management system (BMS) in furnaces should be reviewed. • Organization should reinforce the system of reporting of unsafe act emphasising acts of procedural bypasses, not following SOP, etc. followed by appropriate rectification measure and dissemination of learnings in endeavour to enhance the safety culture in line with OISD-GDN-206 cl no 5.1.4. • Position of stack damper, while in operation shall be distinctly visible from ground as per clause no.5.4 of OISD-STD-111. • A position based ‘Three-Dimensional Competency Grid’ including basic requirements, technical competencies and behavioral competencies to be developed to have a structured mechanism for tracking competency requirement, availability, interventions required and outcomes. Organization to ensure compliance of Cl. 7.2 of “Report of the Working Group on Safety in Indian Petroleum Sector”. Structured training in functional safety shall be provided to all employees in line with Cl. 6.1.3 of OISD-STD-154. • OWS open pits/ funnels within 15 M of furnace shall be relocated in line with Cl. 4.1 of OISD- STD-111. ************ This Case Study is based on the Investigation report done by OISD and published for information purpose only.

Fatal accident at maintenance fabrication yard during cleaning & stacking of tubes,Refinery Loss/ Outcome: One fatality BRIEF OF INCIDENT The injured person (IP) was engaged in cleaning & stacking of tubes of exchanger that were to be used for retubing in the maintenance fabrication yard near Crude Distillation Unit (CDU-III) of a refinery,,"CASE STUDY OISD/CS/2024-25/P&E/11 Dt.: 10/10/24 INTRODUCTION Title: Fatal accident at maintenance fabrication yard during cleaning & stacking of tubes. Location: Refinery Loss/ Outcome: One fatality BRIEF OF INCIDENT The injured person (IP) was engaged in cleaning & stacking of tubes of exchanger that were to be used for retubing in the maintenance fabrication yard near Crude Distillation Unit (CDU-III) of a refinery. The IP got entrapped below the tubes stacked at a height of around 3 feet from ground level at around 01:00 hrs. The IP was engaged in cleaning & stacking of tubes of exchanger that were to be used for retubing. He was shifted to Refinery OHC for first aid and then shifted to M/s VKM hospital, where he was declared dead at 01:50 hrs. OBSERVATIONS / SHORTCOMINGS 1. The temporary structure that collapsed had various flaws like  Base plates, mandated to support all vertical metallic pipes, were not used.  Bracings, essential for providing longitudinal stability, were absent. Any guideline for ascertaining the structural strength (load bearing capacity) of the temporary structure was not evident, neither any assessment was done. Further, evaluation of the structural stability was also not carried out. On calculation, it is arrived that at the time of the collapse, the temporary structure was bearing a load of about 3,300 kg of U-tubes. In absence of guidelines for the temporary structure made of scaffold material, and hence, considering the scaffolding standards outlined in OISD-GDN-192, the load on the structure would have warranted a construction similar to a medium-duty scaffolding. According to these safety standards, medium-duty scaffolding requires a maximum bay length (the distance between two vertical supports) of 1.8 meters. However, the actual distance exceeded this prescribed limit, which contributed to the instability and subsequent failure of the structure. The above observations implied that the temporary structure was not constructed with the necessary strength to bear and transmit the imposed loads to the ground. It was neither adequately secured nor stiffened in both longitudinal and transverse directions, as required by safety standards. 2. It was observed that in many areas, similar types of temporary structures made from scaffolding materials were used for stacking various materials. However, there were no safety guidelines in place for such temporary structures, whether used for short-term or long-term stacking/storage. Provided for information purpose only. This information should be evaluated to determine if it is applicable in your operations, to avoid recurrence of such incidents.3. The Hot Work Permit issued for welding, cutting, grinding, and stress-relieving work related to the retubing of eight exchangers in the maintenance area. The following were observed:  The task of tube cleaning and stacking were not part of the job description covered by the permit. This indicates that the job which led to the fatality was conducted without proper authorization and without a valid work permit.  The work permit was issued and received by the same authorized person, implying issuing of permit to oneself, which was a violation of clause no. 6.4.1 (vi) of OISD-STD-105.  There was no standard maintenance procedure available for the cleaning, oiling and stacking of the tubes. Additionally, no Job Safety Analysis (JSA) was conducted for the retubing work, and no record of a toolbox talk was available, which is a violation of clause no. 6.3.1 of OISD-STD-105.  Verification and tagging of scaffolding/temporary platforms for healthiness, was marked as ""Not Required,"" despite the use of scaffolding albeit as a temporary structure.  Adequate, ventilation and lighting, was marked as completed. However, a site visit during the night revealed the lighting to be inadequate.  The permit issuer cum receiver during interaction informed that he had not visited the site before signing the permits. He only arrived at the site after the IP had already been transferred to the Occupational Health Centre (OHC). 4. During the investigation, the storage location of the procured exchanger tubes was found to be an open yard without any protective shed. Upon evaluating the condition of the U-tubes, it was evident that no oil preservative coating or black bituminous paint had been applied to the tubes, indicating non-compliance with proper preservation measures. 5. None of the workmen reported the incident through any established communication channels to any personnel. Instead, all the workers were solely focused on rescuing the injured individual, collectively managing and transporting the person in pick-up van to the Occupational Health Centre (OHC). The rescue personnel did not even call for the ambulance/ fire & safety. In absence of any information, the OHC personnel did not specifically prepare for attending IP on arrival. 6. The contractor safety training module included emergency contact numbers, and placards/signage displaying these numbers were positioned at the entry to the fabrication yard. Although walkie- talkie sets were not provided, intrinsically safe mobiles were issued to supervisors for communication purposes. However, the review revealed that these handsets required the entry of a prefix code before dialling any emergency numbers. It was found that the workmen were unaware of this code, and it was neither included in the training module nor displayed at the yard. Additionally, no intercom telephone system, PA system, MCP, or other nearby communication devices were available for use in the event of an emergency. Collapsed structure without base plate, braces, safety signage Provided for information purpose only. This information should be evaluated to determine if it is applicable in your operations, to avoid recurrence of such incidents.Stacking of U-Tube bundle beside the collapsed structure Yard where the procured tubes were stored Pictures taken after the incident REASONS OF FAILURE / ROOT CAUSE The root cause of the incident was usage of an inadequately constructed structure and the failure of system to prevent/ check the same. RECOMMENDATIONS 1. Guideline for temporary structures and its usage should be developed. The usage of the temporary structure should be restricted to the load for which it is designed. The authorization and certification processes shall be ensured for all temporary structures. 2. Work permit system shall be aligned with the stipulations of OISD-STD-105 and it shall be ensured that the checklist is duly filled by competent personnel after site visit only. 3. For jobs for which SOP is unavailable (for safe execution), it is mandatory to carry out JSA before issuing the work permit as per clause no. 6.3.1 of OISD-STD-105. Further, toolbox talk (TBT) shall be conducted at the job site before the commencement of the job as per clause no. 6.3.3 of OISD- STD-105. The frequency of toolbox meetings shall be documented in the JSA. 4. Proper preservation process of spares should be ensured in line with clause no 4.3.2 OISD-STD- 171. 5. Robust emergency communication systems, including intercoms, PA systems, intrinsically proof mobile phone and accessible emergency contact numbers, should be established and maintained. All workers should be trained on their use and understand any necessary procedures inclusive of emergency communication procedures, including any prefix codes required for dialling emergency numbers. Configuring emergency numbers in all the handsets being provided to contract personnel should be ensured. 6. Rescue activities should preferably be carried out by trained personnel. Ambulance services should be preferably utilised for movement of casualty. Mock-drills for rescue should be carried out to ensure awareness to all. Provided for information purpose only. This information should be evaluated to determine if it is applicable in your operations, to avoid recurrence of such incidents."
Major accident during activity of putting soap solution to the chain conveyer soap tray,LPG Bottling Plant Result/ outcome: Amputation of contract worker’s right hand,27/09/2024,"के स $डी / CASE STUDY OISD/CS/2024-25/MOLPG/10 Dt.: 27/09/2024 INTRODUCTION Title: Major accident during activity of putting soap solution to the chain conveyer soap tray. Location: LPG Bottling Plant Result/ outcome: Amputation of contract worker’s right hand. BRIEF OF INCIDENT For lubrication of chain conveyor, plant has dedicated service water line with quick shut off valve at tray of each Drive Unit. Soap solution is put into the tray manually by bucket-mug arrangement and mixed with water by opening the valve to create soap lather for lubrication. A contract workman was assigned the task of putting soap solution and topping up of soap solution tray by opening the water pipe gate valve for chain lubrication. Instead of going to the other side of the chain conveyor where the tap of water line was located, workman attempted to operate the water tap through the available space beyond the sprocket beneath the chain conveyor. He extended his right hand under the conveyor belt, very close to the sprocket of Drive Unit. He was wearing rubber gloves that covered his hand up to the elbow. This action caused his glove to come into contact with the sprocket and further his hand near elbow also got trapped in the sprocket resulting in the amputation of his right hand. OBSERVATIONS/ SHORTCOMINGS The observations are as follows: - 1. IP (Injured person) operated the water tap from the incorrect side of the conveyor belt indicating casual approach by him violating standard practice. 2. The water tap near the soap trays is positioned too close to the running sprockets. 3. The loading area lacks a safe passage for movement between the Hot Air Sealing unit and the conveyor belts. Crossover is not available for the conveyor loop. 4. There is no protection around the sprockets. 5. Rubber hand glove being used by the personnel on soap duty is having loose open ends extended up to the elbow, making it prone for easily getting trapped in the moving parts. 6. It appears that similar shortcuts are being taken during topping up of soap solution tray however the same gone unidentified because the culture of identifying unsafe act & condition was missing. Provided for information purpose only. This information should be evaluated to determine if it is applicable in your operations, to avoid recurrence of such incidents.PROBABLE REASON OF FAILURE/ROOT CAUSE: The root cause of the subject incident is negligent act by contract workman by extending hand below the running conveyor without stopping it and operating valve from the wrong side. RECOMMENDATIONS: The recommendations are as follows: - 1 Standard operating Procedure: - SOP for soap solution pouring work to be prepared, approved and displayed at work. Proper training and adherence to established procedures to be ensured. 2 Relocation of Water Tap: - Possibilities may be explored to position the water tap suitably. Additionally, water taps may be installed on both sides of the tray for easier access and safer operation. 3 Sprocket Guard Installation: - Possibility to be explored to Install suitable safety guards on both sides of the sprockets to prevent accidental contact and ensure additional safety. 4 Behaviour based safety culture to be implemented. 7. Suitable hand gloves should be used so that loose open ends can be avoided. 8. Normalization of deviation if any to be noticed and reported as unsafe act and unsafe condition. 9. Cross-Over Installation: - Cross-over to be provided for ease of personnel movements so that people don’t get trapped inside any conveyor loop. Provided for information purpose only.

Fire incident during maintenance activity,"Refinery Loss/ Outcome: INR 85 lacs BRIEF OF INCIDENT The motor of total pump around (TPA) pump of Jute Batching Oil (JBO) stripper column in vicinity of the stripper rundown pump and located below the pipe rack in Combined Distillation unit(CDU), was to be removed from field and taken to workshop for shaft hub job to align it with the new coupling",,"CASE STUDY OISD/CS/2024-25/P&E/09 Dated: 23/09/24 INTRODUCTION Title: Fire incident during maintenance activity. Location: Refinery Loss/ Outcome: INR 85 lacs BRIEF OF INCIDENT The motor of total pump around (TPA) pump of Jute Batching Oil (JBO) stripper column in vicinity of the stripper rundown pump and located below the pipe rack in Combined Distillation unit(CDU), was to be removed from field and taken to workshop for shaft hub job to align it with the new coupling. The forklift was brought to the location for motor removal job. Two contract workmen of rotary department hooked up a web sling in eye bolt of the motor to lift it, but fork could not be brought above eyebolt level as its travel was restricted due to an overhead beam of the pipe rack. Hence, the lifting was stopped, and the forklift backed out. While backing the forklift, a sudden release of hot hydrocarbon occurred. The released hot hydrocarbon caught fire within moments. OBSERVATIONS / SHORTCOMINGS At the time of site visit by the investigation team, the following were observed: 1. One of the impulse line HP tapping of flow transmitter of JBO rundown pumps’ common discharge line, was found sheared from the orifice flange (upstream of root valve). 2. The flow transmitter connection piping upto root valve was found bent implying being hit and dragged. 3. The impulse line was just above the TPA pump whose motor was attempted to be lifted. 4. The height of the tapping was 3350mm. The forklift mast height was 2250mm. On lifting the forklift, the height can reach upto 3500mm. 5. There was a scaffolding immediately in front of motor of TPA pump that was hindering free movement of both man and vehicle. This was built in two month ago for completing the post turn around insulation jobs in pipe alley. 6. Process parameter was checked for any abnormality but was found normal in DCS trends prior to incident. 7. The JBO rundown was at the temperature of 331°C. The autoignition temperature of the material was 310°C. 8. Although the site survey had been done by the Maintenance Engineer prior to execution of job, he had failed to assess the clearance available for lifting of the motor, resulting in failure in task of upliftment of motor. 9. It was observed that in the work permit issued for vehicle entry under the hot work permit category, any requirement of JSA and supervision was not mentioned.10. The unit was under M&I shutdown four months ago of the incident. During the M&I shut down, hydrotest of the JBO circuit was done at 20kg/cm2 and no leak/ pressure drop had been observed. Thickness survey was also carried out of the same circuit and thickness was found in allowable limit. Impulse Line of FT411 that sheared off.

Subsequently, the flow must have ebbed till the line emptied, resulting in significant release of hot hydrocarbon in open atmosphere 12. JBO Pump one year PM records checked for any abnormal vibration or another abnormality, but no abnormality was observed. 13. Forklift fitness certificate was (FORM-11) in order and the equipment was fit for use. Forklift operator’s driving license was valid for forklift operation. 14. In the forklift work-order/ contract did not mention about any training requirement of forklift operation. Induction safety training had been provided to the operator. 15. No CCTV was installed in the unit. 16. Major damage occurred to electrical/instrument cables, cable tray, light fittings, pipes, flanges, etc. All the six tiers of pipe rack were found affected by fire. Total 22 lines were affected. Six number utility lines (2” and below) were observed sagged and bowed. No sagging was observed in any structure. Total damage (Static + Electrical + Instrumentation) was evaluated around INR85 lacs as per the detailed submitted by the entity. REASONS OF FAILURE / ROOT CAUSE Based on the site conditions, statements and incident scene recreation, it was concluded that forklift hit the flow transmitter impulse piping during the backing of the forklift after abandoning the lift operation (without fully lowering the fork) resulting in shearing of the impulse line piping from the root. The JBO in the pipeline, which was above auto ignition temperature (i.e. 310°C), gushed out and self-ignited, resulting in the fire. RECOMMENDATIONS 1. Operators of mobile lifting equipment (inclusive of crane/forklift/Farhana) shall have minimum training in line with procedure given in IS13583. A robust mechanism should be developed for competency assessment before deploying the person. As per High Level Committee recommendations (Ref. recommendation 14 of HLC on Baghjan incident)- Competency criteria of key operating personnel shall be explicitly included in tender and to be ensured. 2. Safe work practice shall be ensured as per Cl.7.3 of OISD-GDN-206 like, Identification of anticipated or inherent/ specific hazard in running plant full of hydrocarbon and risk involved should be done through:  Systematic evaluation of stepwise activities involved in the non-routine job or it’s execution.  Identification of possible unsafe conditions in the surrounding  Identification of Hazard and risk from other job in the vicinity (if any). The TBRA/JSA shall be job specific. It shall identify the hazards, potential consequences, and risks associated with job as per Cl.6.3.1 of OISD-STD-105. 3.

Fire in a Battery Room Location: Offshore wellhead platform,Offshore wellhead platform,,"CASE STUDY OISD/CS/2024-25/E&P/08 Dt.:04.09.2024 INTRODUCTION Title: Fire in a Battery Room Location: Offshore wellhead platform. Loss/ Outcome: Fire damage to battery room and nearby areas BRIEF OF INCIDENT: A fire broke out in the battery room of an offshore wellhead platform of an organization. Smoke was noticed by crew members on a nearby manned platform almost 10 hours after the fire had started. The power supply to the wellhead platform from the FPSO, where well fluids from wells of the platform were processed and which supplied power to the well platform, was cut off and all the wells of the wellhead platform were closed. The fire, triggered by a thermal runaway reaction in the Nickel- Cadmium (Ni-Cad) batteries, resulted in the burning out of 352 batteries. It also caused significant fire damage to the electrical infrastructure and inflicted heat-related damage to the adjacent shelter room. OBSERVATIONS/ SHORTCOMINGS 1. The battery room contained four banks of Nickel Cadmium batteries. In November 2022, three of these battery banks of a particular make were supplied, installed, and commissioned by an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). These batteries have since been observed to exhibit overheating and high current withdrawal, indicating potential quality or installation issues that may be leading to a thermal runaway reaction. 2. There was a significant delay in deploying the engineers from OEM to investigate the initial heating reports. The organization seemed overly reliant on the OEM to resolve the issue, rather than taking proactive steps or exploring alternative solutions. 3. Despite battery heating issues being reported, the organization failed to implement regular battery room monitoring. No record of monitoring was not available for the last month till the fire incident. Despite intimation from the organization to the OEM about the potential for battery fires and the need for isolation, neither action was taken. 4. The signal alarm due to the presence of smoke in the battery room was transmitted to the SCADA system on FPSO at midnight on the date of the incident. However, the alarms were in an inhibited state and the SCADA system for the Well Head platforms was not being monitored at night. Furthermore, the night data was not reviewed in the morning. This Case study is based on the Investigation report submitted by committee and published for information purpose only. This information should be evaluated to determine if it is applicable in your operations, to avoid recurrence of such incidents.5. There were significant deficiencies in maintaining, documenting, and managing safety-critical equipment. All the three H detectors were faulty. No Bypass was taken to mitigate the risks 2 associated with the non-functional equipment. No authorization from the appropriate management level was obtained to continue operations. There was no record of the calibration of gas detectors positioned near the air intake duct outside of the battery room. 6. A review of the ventilation room's preventive maintenance (PM) records showed insufficient maintenance activities due to the absence of a checklist. Although parameters like insulation resistance, winding resistance, and current drawn were recorded, the ventilation system's efficacy was not evaluated. 7. It was also observed that no internal audit was conducted to assess the hazards and risks of the wellhead platform. 8. Emergency response plan was available at the FPSO. However, the scenario of electrical fire or fire in the battery room was not included in the emergency response platform. CONCLUSION / ROOT CAUSE 1. The fire incident was due to the continuous overheating and overcharging of the Ni-Cadmium battery banks supplied by OEM which led to a thermal runaway condition within the battery banks. 2. Organization's over-reliance on OEM for resolving battery issues without seeking alternative solutions or taking independent actions led to significant delays in addressing critical battery problems. 3. The absence of continuous battery room monitoring when batteries were heating allowed critical parameters like voltage and temperature to escalate without detection. SCADA system for well-head platforms was not monitored at night, and alarms were in an inhibited state. There was no action for about 11 hours. RECOMMENDATIONS 1. Preventing Runaway reaction in Nickel-Cadmium batteries: a) Battery temperatures should be maintained within optimal ranges as specified by the OEM. [Refer clause 6.2.1.3 of IEEE Std 1635-2012/ASHRAE Guideline 21-2012]. b) Battery management system (BMS) should be used to control the amount of charge and output of battery systems. BMS are meant to shut down or control the battery before thermal run-away may occur. [Refer to clause 52.3.2 of NFPA-1]. c) A system to disconnect batteries in case of ventilation failure should be ensured. [Refer to clause 10.3.4.3.7.2 of API 7F-2018] 2. Competency building: a) The organization should establish a rapid response protocol to address for equipment failures, including battery heating issues, with defined action timelines. This protocol should incorporate contingency plans for independent action when external support is unavailable. To mitigate delays in response to battery heating issues organization should broaden its service provider network beyond the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) by exploring alternative service options. b) A training program should be developed and imparted to maintenance crew members to equip maintenance crew members with the knowledge and skills necessary for effective This Case study is based on the Investigation report submitted by committee and published for information purpose only. This information should be evaluated to determine if it is applicable in your operations, to avoid recurrence of such incidents.troubleshooting and maintenance of the battery and charger systems. Basic electrical safety training should be imparted to service officers at the installation as per the requirement of training course 201 and 202 of OISD-STD-176. 3. Quality assurance during procurement: A stricter quality assurance procedure should be enforced during battery procurement and installation. The past performance and safety of batteries from different suppliers under identical conditions may be evaluated before procurement. 4. Battery Banks Monitoring, Preventive Maintenance and Isolation Protocols: a) A detailed preventive maintenance checklist as per OEM guidelines should be developed and followed. It shall be ensured that checklists cover all critical parameters. b) The manufacturer guidelines for maintenance, particularly regarding cell voltage levels and procedures for handling cells with voltages below specified thresholds should be strictly followed for troubleshooting as per OEM. c) Regular monitoring should be implemented for battery parameters, including temperature, voltage, and current, to detect anomalies early and prevent potential failures. Additionally, clear protocols for isolating batteries should be established if abnormal conditions are detected, ensuring that the risk of overheating or thermal runaway is minimized. d) The SCADA systems for Well Head platforms should be actively monitored at all times (both day and night times). The alarm management protocols shall be reviewed and revised to prevent alarms from being inhibited. 5. Gas and Heat Detection: All existing faulty hydrogen detectors should be replaced/rectified with reliable ones in the battery room. Calibration of gas detectors and H detectors should be executed 2 without exception as per OEM guidelines/company policy. A bypass should be undertaken with proper level of authorization in accordance with company policy when safety-critical equipment is non-operational or malfunctioning or non-available. 6. Ventilation System: The efficacy of ventilation systems in battery rooms should be regularly assessed. The alarm or safety interlock that gets activated upon loss of ventilation should be explored for transmitting signals to the manned station. 7. Fire Suppression System: A fire assessment study should be conducted to determine the necessity of a firefighting system in the battery room. [Refer to clause N 52.3.2.7 of NFPA-1, 2018] 8. Emergency Response Plan: The scenario for fire in the battery room should be included in the emergency response plan for Well Head platforms. Regular emergency response training drills shall be conducted for personnel to effectively respond to fire and other emergencies on Well Head platforms. 9.

Fatal accident due to fall from height,Construction Site at Refinery Expansion Project,,"CASE STUDY OISD/CS/2024-25/P&E/08 Dt.:20.08.2024 INTRODUCTION Title: Fatal accident due to fall from height. Location: Construction Site at Refinery Expansion Project. Loss/ Outcome: One fatality. BRIEF OF INCIDENT: A contract worker (hereinafter called Injured Person (IP)), employed by a subcontractor of a Lump Sum Turnkey (LSTK) contractor suffered a fatal injury after falling from 23 m to 17 m level of an under- construction pipe rack (fig 1). He was engaged in paint marking of tightened bolts of the beam of the structure of the Main Pipe Rack. OBSERVATIONS/ SHORTCOMINGS 1. Structural work was under progress in a section of the Main Pipe Rack (fig 2), including torquing, bolting, and yellow paint marking of tightened bolts. Blanket Work Permits had been issued by the company. On the day of the incident, IP was assigned to carry out paint marking of tightened bolts. 2. As observed, at the location where IP was working, beam bolts were marked with yellow paint. Hence, probably after performing the paint-marking job, IP did not hook-up the lanyard of the ‘Full Body Safety Harness (FBH)’ with the anchor point. He deviated from the guidance provided in Toolbox Talk (TBT), Job Safety Analysis (JSA), Work Permit (WP) etc. 3. Check-listing/ verification of control measures mentioned in the JSA (which was a standard one for bolting) for the incident site location was not evident, implying that job specific compliance was not being ascertained on a day-wise/ location-wise basis 4. It was evident that for the bolt torquing of the beam at incident location, no scaffolding platform had been provided for torquing and painting of the bolts on the lower side of the beam. Workers had carried out torque bolting by sitting over the beam and working bending downwards. IP had also stepped on the beam to carry out the paint-marking job. This digress possibility had not been considered in the JSA. 5. Injured Person was imparted induction training. However, subsequent plant/project-work specific safety training/ task specific safety training was not evident. 6. The IP had involved in other unsafe acts in the past, as noted in the master list of UA-UC (Contractor), with violations and counseling recorded. 7. Repeated unsafe acts by other workers, such as improper use of tools, lanyards and FBH lanyard knots, were also reported. Scaffold-related unsafe conditions were also reported on the Company’s portal. 8. Toolbox talks were conducted daily, with ""hook at height, FBH anchoring"" discussed as a topic. No special training for the subcontractor's supervisor was evident. 9. Contractor maintained a register of safety violations with records of punitive actions. Not anchoring the FBH while working at height was recorded with penalties ranging from warnings to suspension. 10. The LSTK contractor was aware that there were inaccessible areas where a crane with a basket could not approach, but no alternative rescue arrangements were planned. 11. The owner’s Fire & Safety (F&S) group received communication about the accident after about 13 minutes through safety supervisor under contract of owner who cycled to F&S station in absence This Case study is based on the Investigation report submitted by committee and published for information purpose only. This information should be evaluated to determine if it is applicable in your operations, to avoid recurrence of such incidents.of communication facility available at the project site. Reportedly, due to apprehension of labor unrest/ mob agitation at the site, the F&S personnel did not respond quick enough to aid in the rescue/ evacuation activities or to control the mob. The rescue operation was entirely carried out by contract workers who were not trained for the task. After about 25 mins the injured person was brought to ground level and shifted into the ambulance. 12. Previous mock drills did not include rescue scenarios from height, and there was no evidence of contractor personnel being trained for such rescues. A recommendation for height rescue drills was mentioned in a project safety meeting records, but no drills were conducted before the incident. Fig-1 Fall of height Fig-2 Main Pipe rack CONCLUSION / ROOT CAUSE The root-cause of the incident was the unsafe act by IP of not anchoring the double lanyard. Further, a mechanism to prevent the unsafe act/condition (inadequate scaffold working platform and not anchoring the double lanyard while working at height) was also missing. RECOMMENDATIONS 1. Robust mechanism shall be developed to prevent unsafe acts/ unsafe conditions. This shall include adequate/ repeated awareness sessions in line with OISD-GDN-192 clause 11. Monitoring of project activities through CCTV with adequate recording facility should be reviewed and scrutiny of the footages, manually or through AI techniques, should be explored to identify unsafe acts/ conditions and take rectification measures thereof. Team responsibility amongst team members for each other should be encouraged and promoted so that they point out and rectify unsafe acts, even of fellow workmen, in their own interest and of their fellow workmen. 2. JSA should be work and job location specific in line with clause 6.3.1 (v) of OISD-STD-105. In case of template developed for a specific kind of job, verification of control measures identified shall be ensured by means of checklist workwise/ location-wise. For any abnormality, the JSA should be revisited/ redone. 3. Safety awareness training shall be ensured in line with OISD-STD-154. Further, since day-to-day supervision of contract workforce is done by the supervisor of contractor, special emphasis must be given to the minimum competency criteria and mandatory This Case study is based on the Investigation report submitted by committee and published for information purpose only. This information should be evaluated to determine if it is applicable in your operations, to avoid recurrence of such incidents.training/ certification required for the contractor supervisors in the tender document in line with clause 7.3.2.4 of ‘Report of the Working Group on Safety in Indian Petroleum Sector’. 4. Scaffoldings with adequate platforms, handrails and all stipulated appurtenances should be available at work locations at height in line with OISD-GDN-192. 5. The provision of adequate communication means like walkie-talkies should be reviewed at the project site. 6. Alternative rescue arrangements should be developed and implemented for inaccessible areas where cranes with baskets cannot approach. The Provision for evacuating Injured person from elevations using devices like Rope Access Device and Lift Rescue along with suitable stretchers from elevations shall be reviewed. Training/ mock drills including Company, Contractor and subcontractor should be conducted to ensure the effectiveness and readiness of these rescue arrangements. 7. A zero-tolerance policy for operational lapses should be developed and responsibility fixed on all persons responsible for the lapses. Similarly, responsibility should be fixed on the contractor’s company for its functional lapses and action taken against it for the acts of omission and commission contributing to the incident. ************ This Case study is based on the Investigation report submitted by committee and published for information purpose only.

Fatal accident during hydrostatic testing of fin-fan cooler,Refinery Loss/ Outcome: One fatality BRIEF OF INCIDENT The injured person (IP) was engaged in hydrotest job of one of the fin-fan air coolers of the under-shutdown Hydro-Cracker Unit of a refinery,,"CASE STUDY OISD/CS/2024-25/P&E/02 Dt.: 16/7/24 INTRODUCTION Title: Fatal accident during hydrostatic testing of fin-fan cooler. Location: Refinery Loss/ Outcome: One fatality BRIEF OF INCIDENT The injured person (IP) was engaged in hydrotest job of one of the fin-fan air coolers of the under-shutdown Hydro-Cracker Unit of a refinery. The fin-fan cooler platform was at around 14.4 m height. Around 02:00 hrs, a loud sound was heard, and the IP fell from the fin-fan cooler platform. The IP was found lying near the heater area on the ground level, bleeding profusely. The IP was shifted to Occupational Health Centre (OHC). Duty doctor upon checking the IP in the ambulance advised to shift him immediately to the nearby hospital, as the injury was assessed to be very severe (open chest) requiring a specialised treatment (trauma surgeon). The IP on reaching hospital was declared dead. OBSERVATIONS / SHORTCOMINGS 1. At the time of site visit by the investigation team, the following were observed:  The plug (bolt) of the cooler tube was found stuck in the chuck of the pneumatic torque wrench and its thread was intact without any perceptible sign of shearing. The broken wrench (which could be used for both ways, i.e. tightening as well as loosening based on a provided switch) was found at the grade level a few meters away from IP. The pneumatic hose of the torque wrench was still hanging on the air fin cooler platform.  The tube threads, whose bolt was stuck in the chuck of the wrench, were found intact, and no sign of shearing was evident implying that it had been opened.  Hand railing at the south side of the fin-fan cooler was bent implying that the railing was hit by an object (probably by pneumatic torque wrench) with force.  The lighting post facing the fin-fan cooler was distorted, detached and leaning over. The post was probably hit by the IP.  Pipeline near the feed filter area at grade level, where the IP fell, were damaged at several places. Provided for information purpose only. This information should be evaluated to determine if it is applicable in your operations, to avoid recurrence of such incidents. The fin-fan cooler tube bundle had been positively isolated (blinded); hence, no trends of pressure were available in the DCS graphics. A pressure gauge had been connected to the exchanger bundle on north side to see the pressure while hydrotesting. Pictures of damaged structures/ equipment taken after the incident 2. The log data revealed that some workmen, including those who were on duty along with IP on the incident day, were performing duty for more than 16 hours against the stipulation of State Factories Rules. Introspection/ action by the installation for the contravention of factory rules was not evident. 3. The conditions stipulated in work order specifies that the contractor must ensure relevant manpower to carryout job of this nature. Specific conditions & details of “relevant manpower” were not mentioned in the terms & conditions. Also, the work order did not mention anything about the minimum training requirements or competency of the contract workmen, including supervisor & safety supervisor. 4. Based on the written statement & interaction with the site supervisor, it was informed that he was involved with the contractor since past 12 years and had gained experience by virtue of his involvement with similar nature of works as a site supervisor. During interaction, it was observed that the level of Provided for information purpose only. This information should be evaluated to determine if it is applicable in your operations, to avoid recurrence of such incidents.competency of hazard identification and risk assessment was not up to the mark. No training records could be provided by the contractor. 5. The conditional requirement for deployment of safety supervisor was not met by the contractor on the day of incident. It was also uncertain whether safety supervisor was deployed during other days when the other exchangers (6) hydrotest activity was carried out. 6. As per contract conditions, the entire job was subject to inspection, approval & acceptance by the EIC/ Inspection. Conformance to the above requirement during execution of such critical activities was not evident. 7. Significant lapses in selecting the work permit conditions were noticed.  Area cordoned off was marked as “Not Required”, requirements of PPE was also casually & randomly selected (marked for “welding suit”, “boiler suit”, “dust respirator”, etc.)  No record of toolbox talk & no risk assessment (JSA) had been conducted.  No provision of mentioning JSA number in the work permit & the work permit format used was not in line with latest OISD-STD-105.  Many criteria as specified in “Standard Procedure for Hydrotesting” were not complied viz. lack of risk assessment and hazards associated with the job, non-barricading of hydrotesting area, test results were not documented, non-revision of standard procedures, non-mentioning of “no repair work/ tightening” during pressurised condition were observed. 8. Another SOP furnished to the investigating team, made specifically for the equipment maintenance job, was in a non-standard format with no information about the review/ approval history, no date of approval, no document related information, etc. indicating that it had been prepared post incident. 9. During interaction with operations/ production personnel, it was informed that the role of shift operations with respect to the activity of fin-fan cooler job was limited to issuing work permits as the equipment was completely isolated & blinded and the entire scope of job was being executed by Maintenance/ Inspection departments. 10. No uniform nomenclature of the equipment was observed. It was also observed during interaction that a sort of non-clarity of equipment identification was existing amongst the workmen & other persons. 11. CCTV coverage during the time of incident was focussed towards other area, where some other maintenance activity was going on parallelly. 12. The FIR provided to OISD was not very clear regarding the cause of accident and indicated an incident of accidental fall implying an occupational accident. However, the accident was more of a process nature, occurring on account of accidental release of high pressure. REASONS OF FAILURE / ROOT CAUSE From the fact that the plug was stuck inside the chuck of torque wrench machine, it is conceived that IP attempted to tighten the plug to arrest the sweating (leak) and might have accidently loosened it (The thread of the plug and the tube were intact and there was no sign of shearing) while the equipment was still in pressurised condition for hydrotesting. Whether the decision to do the task was given by someone or by the victim himself could not be established. It is possible that IP might have been instructed to tighten the plug while the others went to the north side to see the pressure and release it. As there was no means of communication between the other team members and IP (additionally, the gauge was not visible to the IP as he was on other side of the tube bundle), IP might not have known whether the pressure was released or not. Alternatively, due to the continuous work hours and resultant fatigue, IP might have thought of finishing the job by tightening the bolts. Provided for information purpose only. This information should be evaluated to determine if it is applicable in your operations, to avoid recurrence of such incidents.RECOMMENDATIONS 1. No repair activity shall be carried out while the equipment is pressurised for hydrotest. During hydrotest activity, area around the equipment subject to testing shall be barricaded and unauthorised entry shall be restricted. 2. Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) A. Non-standard and non-approved SOPs shall be discontinued. B. All SOPs shall be reviewed, revised and approved at least every three years and in accordance with clause no. 7.2.4 of OISD-GDN-206. C. SOPs specific to the nature of job should be shared to the executing agency or the agency should be made aware of the practices/ procedures for executing the job in a safe manner as per the methodology described in SOP. D. All steps of the approved SOP should be adhered to and any violation should be brought to notice of concerned authority and corrective measure taken. For example, non-availability of additional pressure gauge, during hydrotest activity, should have been reported and corrected. 3. Management should promote all interested parties for reporting of unsafe acts, unsafe conditions and near misses as per clause no.5.1.1(k) of OISD-GDN-206. 4. All the work permit conditions should be verified, conditions to be ensured at the site and then only the work permit to be issued. Organizations should review their work permit system and align with the latest OISD-STD-105. 5. Periodical visit to site shall be ensured by the concerned groups to check the compliance of the work permit conditions. 6. Compliance to the working hours of contract workmen in-line with the state factories rules shall be ensured. 7. Monitoring of critical activities through CCTV with adequate recording facility shall be ensured. Scrutiny of footage manually or through AI techniques should be explored to identify unsafe acts/ conditions and take rectification measures thereof. 8. Adequate means of communication like walkie-talkie should be ensured during execution of critical activities. 9. First Information Report (FIR) should elucidate all the facts of incident. 10. Hydrotest record shall be maintained in standard format (including the pressure, duration, pressure increment, etc.) related to hydrotesting process for compliance and future reference. Use of chart recorder/ pressurisation chart during hydrotest should be explored. 11. Management shall carry out gap analysis of the safety management system with respect to the working group report and OISD-GDN-206. Necessary corrective actions shall be taken as per the gap analysis recommendations. 12.

Fatal incident in Pipeline ROW during excavation for TLP cable repair,Pipeline road crossing,12/07/2024,"CASE STUDY OISD/CS/2024-25/PL/07 Dt.: 12/07/2024 INTRODUCTION Title: Fatal incident in Pipeline ROW during excavation for TLP cable repair. Location: Pipeline road crossing. Loss/ Outcome: One Fatality. BRIEF OF INCIDENT Periodic cathodic protection monitoring of pipeline indicated that at one location test lead point cables from pipeline to test lead point (TLP) box was damaged and PSP reading was not coming. Therefore, new cables were required to be laid from TLP box to pipeline and connected to the pipeline. For this work, pipeline excavation was being carried out for exposing pipeline. This repair location of the pipeline was on a state highway & pipeline had crossed the road by cased crossing. Alongside this 12” pipeline, another 20” pipeline was laid at an inter distance of 4 meter. ROW width was 18 meters. On one side of ROW, there was a permanent building (just outside on ROW edge). On other side there was a temporary hutment/ structure (inside ROW). Total ROW width between building & temporary hutment/ structure was 30 feet (9.14 meter). Maximum pipeline depth at road crossing was 3.66 meter as per latest CAT survey report. Deep rooted trees and bushes were also present in the ROW. Schematic of site is shown in Figure No. 1. Photograph of site is shown in Figure No. 2. On 23.05.24, Mainline maintenance contractor was carrying out excavation work for TLP cable installation without informing the pipeline owner. During excavation, one person, engaged in the process fell in trench accidently, and simultaneously the nearby soil collapsed above him. By the time he was taken out, he could not survive. As per postmortem report, cause of death was due to skull injury. Figure No. 1 Provided for information purpose only. This information should be evaluated to determine if it is applicable in your operations, to avoid recurrence of such incidents.Figure No. 2 OBSERVATIONS / CONTRADICTIONS Basis site visit, interaction with officials, contractor and checking of existing systems, procedures and documents various contradictions were observed, which are as below: 1. As per owner, contractor representatives were carrying out work without informing and as per contractor work was not being carried out by him or his team. 2. Five work permits were also issued in May-24 for Mainline repair & maintenance before the incident. But contractor submitted that he had last worked 3-4 months before. Also, in the existing permit system, permits were being received by the Mainline officer, the name of the contractor’s authorized supervisor was not being recorded to whom the permit was being issued. 3. As per owner, even though incident happened over their pipeline on a location where warning board with emergency contact number was displayed, police did not call them. Police took the body & sent it for postmortem. Pipeline owner came to know about the incident the next day through a local newspaper. 4. If contractor submission was considered, then an unauthorized mechanized excavation exactly over the pipeline was done at a busy location, pipeline was exposed and subsequently fatality happened. Local people neither called pipeline control room nor pipeline security personnel. 5. Several system failures were observed like not getting information of unauthorized excavation/ information of such fatal incident from security personnel, who was supposed to have good liaison with villagers. Also, coordination with local police regarding intimation of such incident was found missing. REASONS OF FAILURE / ROOT CAUSE The following were the probable cause of the incident: Provided for information purpose only. This information should be evaluated to determine if it is applicable in your operations, to avoid recurrence of such incidents.1. Workman might have slipped and fallen from around 12 feet height on any hard item/ pipeline/ JCB bucket leading to skull injury resulting in death. 2. Incident happened because an unsupervised activity was being carried out without considering & mitigating all probable hazards, like excavation up to 3.7 meter (approximately 12 ft) in restricted condition due to presence of another pipeline, temporary encroachment (temporary shed), deep rooted trees in ROW, permanent building adjacent to ROW. RECOMMENDATIONS As major contradictions were observed between versions of pipeline owner and contractor, therefore it was recommended that pipeline owner to constitute a higher-level committee with the scope as listed below: i. To investigate the incident thoroughly to bring out the facts. ii. To find out gaps in contract management with respect to recommendation of Working group report on safety in Indian petroleum sector. iii. Gaps in the role of HSE in executing mainline related jobs. iv. Gaps in existing work permit system with respect to OISD-STD-105. v. Gaps in effectiveness of line walking system, village awareness meets, police meet, existing methodology of recording of ROW encroachments. vi. Methodology to work in challenging conditions like restricted ROW, common ROW, nearby highway etc. ============================== Provided for information purpose only. This information should be evaluated to determine if it is applicable in your operations, to avoid recurrence of such incidents."
Fatal Accident at Wellsite Location: Onshore- Wellsite Loss / Outcome: One fatality and four injuries BRIEF OF INCIDENT A fatal accident occurred at around 1505 hrs,Onshore- Wellsite Loss / Outcome: One fatality and four injuries BRIEF OF INCIDENT A fatal accident occurred at around 1505 hrs,,"CASE STUDY OISD/CS/2024-25/E&P/03 02.05.2024 INTRODUCTION: Title: Fatal Accident at Wellsite Location: Onshore- Wellsite Loss / Outcome: One fatality and four injuries BRIEF OF INCIDENT A fatal accident occurred at around 1505 hrs. on 14.02.2024 at one of the onshore wellsite. Four persons received minor injuries while one person received major injury. All injured crew people were shifted to the hospital, where the person with major injury succumbed to his injury. The incident occurred during bleeding of hydrotest water and gas through 2” bleed line. While opening the 2” valve fitted in the part of the artery line connection, the valve along-with bleed line got dislodged from the changeover nipple and resultant gush of water and gas hit the sand heap nearby. The sandstorm engulfed the entire wellhead area, and the crew was injured by the fast-moving sand particles. Observation / Lapses 1. The detailed plan for the entire job was not prepared / available. 2. The SOP for construction of flowlines was not adequate. 3. No procedure exists for dewatering of gas pipelines after pressure testing. 4. No Anchoring or support was provided to the bleed line. Also, no specific guidelines exist for anchoring and support of the 2-inch portion of the artery line to the well head casing and flow lines. 5. The source of sand heap could not be established. The presence of sand at well plinth was major reason of injuries to the personnel. 6. The sand heap was not removed before starting the bleeding operation. The crewmember did not move to a safe area. 7. The valve fitted by threaded connection on the artery line was not properly secured.8. It was seen that the bend at the end was 90 degrees against the requirements of 45 degree as per SOP, also it was not pointed to vertical. (it was pointed to the side). 9. The Mines Vocational Training (MVT) eco-system had several discrepancies: It is observed that:  No sequence or continuity of certificate numbers, document control is not exercised.  All certificates are hand-written and issued without any authentication like QR code.  Difference in training duration. In some cases, duration of training not mentioned.  Regular refresher courses are not arranged. Root Cause of the Accident a. Non availability of plan for the jobs at well site by Multi-disciplinary team (MDT). b. Unsupported and non-anchored spool used for bleeding the pressure which was not part of SOP. c. No SOP for construction of flow lines, artery lines, gas lift lines. d. Inadequate SOP for hydrotesting. The SOPs should be aligned with OISD standards and statutory requirements. e. Absence of SOP for dewatering gas lines post hydrotest. f. Unsecured valve on threaded connection g. The presence of sand heap in the line of water / gas and too close to the X mas tree. h. The bend at the end was 90 degrees against the requirements of 45 degree as per OIL SOP, also it was not pointed to vertical. This is a violation of the SOP. i. Failure to warn: The personnel present at the site were not properly warned about the likely danger of uncontrolled flow. They were not positioned at a safe distance from the drain point. j. Unsecured well site: The well site is left unsecured. No control on incoming / outgoing material, no control on vehicular movement near the well plinth. Conclusion: The unfortunate incident at well site NHK#162 was avoidable incident. It is seen from the observations and probable reasons that accident occurred due to failure of multiple barriers simultaneously. Some of them are unsecured lines and valves. Non-standard threaded connections on the high-pressure gas line. The presence of sand heap at the site added to the increased severity of the injury.Also, no system or SOP available for construction, testing and dewatering of flow lines and artery lines, attributed to the accident. Recommendations: 1. All the jobs at well-site should be planned in advance preferably by MDT. 2. SOPs should be reviewed. Following SOPs should be considered: i. SOP for construction of Flow lines, Artery lines and Gas lift lines. ii. SOP for Anchoring and support during line connection. iii. SOP for dewatering after Hydrotesting. 3. The Job Safety Analysis shall include identification of unwanted material at site, their analysis for hazards and remedial actions. 4. The operating crew should be sensitized about SOPs that are relevant for the job. The toolbox talk should include details of all the applicable SOPs. 5. The eco system of providing MVT to the employees should be critically examined. The training duration and refresher course should be standardized. 6. MVT certificates should bear QR code and authenticity, and traceability should be provided. 7. Training to be imparted to crew members for safe operation of well testing and maintenance related operation at well site.

Fall & damage of drilling rig mast,Onshore drilling rig,,"CASE STUDY OISD/CS/2024-25/E&P/05 Dt.: 28.05.2024 INTRODUCTION Title: Fall & damage of drilling rig mast. Location: Onshore drilling rig. Loss/ Outcome: Financial Loss. BRIEF OF INCIDENT During lowering of the rig mast, Off Driller side (ODS) Junction point of A frame welded on bottom box snapped causing fall and damage of mast. OBSERVATIONS/ SHORTCOMINGS  Level IV/ III inspection of mast and substructure was not carried out/ due respectively.  The welding/ joint below the cover plate (the joint which failed during mast lowering) and the L shape pipe to which the eye pad is welded has not been inspected during the previous Level III inspection. This suggests that the inspecting agency failed to identify the critical areas which need to be inspected during Level III inspection.  Level II inspection was carried out by the crew prior to mast raising. However, the welding joint was not visually inspected as it was below the cover plate of bottom box. During the investigation, it was evident that that the joint has developed partially crack prior to the incident.  A similar type of incident has happened while raising the mast of similar type of rig, wherein joint of ‘A’ frame with bottom box failed causing mast to fall down from height of 1.5 feet above big horse. The few key recommendations from investigation report were:  Health check/ assessment of rigs being done for repair/ replacement needs to be made stringent to include areas not covered during previous checks based on lessons learnt from the incident.  Inspection of derrick members to be done as per OISD-GDN-202. Provided for information purpose only. This information should be evaluated to determine if it is applicable in your operations, to avoid recurrence of such incidents.However, compliance of the OISD recommendations was not carried out for similar types of rigs which was evident in this particular incident.  During interaction with the rig officers, it emerged out that water filled during the mast raise is not drained every time after the completion of mast raising operation. In the SOP available for mast raising, this aspect was not covered in the procedure whether water should be removed from bottom box or not after mast raise.  During the meeting held with OEM, it was shared that inspection window near the failed joint has been fabricated on other rigs in the asset but there was no such window available at this rig. It was concluded with this fact that visual/ NDT inspection of joint below cover plate of bottom box has not been carried out in the past due to inaccessibility.  A joint inspection of rig was carried out by OEM and the operator almost a year prior to the incident. OEM has provided the list of the recommendations for replacement/ repair of parts of mast and substructure including the replacement of bottom DS & ODS ‘A’ frame and bottom section lugs. However, the job was not carried out till the date of incident.  The painting inside the bottom box was not carried out which was evident as the investigating team observed heavy corrosion in the inside visible portion of the bottom box. ROOT CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT  Nonadherence to the OEM’s recommendation as per joint inspection with the operator.  No provision (like inspection window) for inspection of weld joints of Rear A-Frame lugs on Bottom Box. RECOMMENDATIONS  Level IV inspection of mast and substructure should be carried out every 10 years as per Clause 5.1 of OISD-GDN-202. Operator should formulate a policy for addressing the frequency of Level IV inspection of mast and substructure of the rig based on residual life assessment after rig has completed its design life.  Level III inspection of mast and substructure should be carried out every 2 years as per Clause 5.1 of OISD-GDN-202. Operator should formulate a policy for addressing the frequency of Level III inspection of mast and substructure of the rig based on residual life assessment after rig has completed its design life.  Level III includes NDT of critical areas. It may involve disassembly to access specific components and to identify wear & tear that exceeds the manufacturer's allowable tolerances. A thorough visual inspection of all load bearing components and members should be conducted to determine the condition of the rig equipment and documented. (Ref: Cl 4.3 of OISD-GDN-202). Provided for information purpose only. This information should be evaluated to determine if it is applicable in your operations, to avoid recurrence of such incidents. In case of mast and structures, a thorough & intensive inspection (Level II inspection) of load bearing areas and sheaves for cracks, damage, corrosion, loose or missing components and premature wear is to be carried out (Ref: Cl 4.2 of OISD-GDN-202). This detailed inspection should be performed during rig up operations as per Annexure I of OISD-GDN-202.  Organization should establish the procedure on learning from internal and external incidents. These high value learnings should be coupled with actions directed to prevent the similar incident happening at the facility. The Learning from incident (LFI) should be communicated to similar facilities within the organization. (Ref: Cl 7.9.1(c) of OISD-GDN-206). A procedure should be established to promptly address and resolve the findings and implement recommendations. Resolution and corrective actions should be documented. The procedure should address:  Tracking and monitoring of open, overdue and closed recommendation status  The validation of effectiveness of closed recommendation (Ref: Cl 7.9.1(e) of OISD-GDN-206).  OEM should provide an additional openable inspection window for easy inspection of tubular and weld joints of Rear A-Frame lugs on Bottom Box for old rigs in operations.  Recommendations for repair/ replacement by the inspection party should be complied in a time bound manner. Time bound action plan should be prepared for implementation of the recommendations and the same should be closely monitored in safety committee meetings.  SOP for mast raising should be modified with inclusion of procedure of dumping of water from bottom box after mast raise or use of corrosion inhibitor in water. As per OEM recommendation, water should be drained during drilling operations.  Periodic cleaning and painting of entire Mast, Sub-structure and of inside surfaces of water tank of Bottom Box below Rear-A-Frame should be carried out.

Fatal accident by hook-loaded FARANA crane,Battery area of a Refinery,,"CASE STUDY OISD/CS/2024-25/P&E/04 Dt.:6/6/2024 INTRODUCTION Title: Fatal accident by hook-loaded FARANA crane. Location: Battery area of a Refinery. Loss/ Outcome: Fatality of a contract worker. BRIEF OF INCIDENT: Construction of a new process unit was going on in a vacant plot in a refinery. Due to space constraint, construction material (pipe spool, structure module/ members, etc.) were kept beside a road around 200m away from the construction site. The incident occurred when a Farana crane was transporting members (C-sections of around 300kg and length of 2m max.) from the storage location to the construction site. The material was being transported hook- loaded through the battery area road. A flagman and only one rigger were assisting the crane- operator in the transportation. Schematic layout of incident location At a road junction, the rigger was hit by the Farana crane. The flagman, who was marching forwards, guiding the crane operator, shouted for help. The people working in nearby area rushed to the incident site. The fire station was also informed, and ambulance reached the site. The rigger, hereinafter called as Injured Person (IP), was shifted to refinery hospital by ambulance at 13:20hrs. After IV infusion and wound dressing, IP could not survive due to profuse bleeding. This Case Study is based on the Investigation report done by OISD and published for information purpose only. This information should be evaluated to determine if it is applicable in your operations, to avoid recurrence of such incidents.OBSERVATIONS / Lapses • The incident site was around 10 m from the junction of 2 roads. A truck-trailer was parked on the left side of the road at the incident site. The Farana had turned left and then must have swerved slightly right due to parked truck-trailer. • The incident happened at around 12:45hrs when most of the workers were on lunch break. Crane operator, rigger and flagman were also getting late for lunch. • As per the statement of flagman, IP was moving on the right side of the crane holding the tag line. The flagman was looking forward and giving signals to the Farana crane operator. When he looked back towards the Farana crane, he saw the IP lying on the ground in front of the right wheel. • As per joint statement of Site Manger and Area Manager of Project Management Consultant (PMC), referring to their investigation, IP came in proximity of Farana crane (between boom and Farana jack) and was hit by Farana. • As per the statement of Farana crane operator, he saw IP coming under the boom of the crane for shade, as it was hot and sunny. He also added that IP had been warned against such activity in previous instance also. Then he saw IP falling in front of the crane and immediately applied brake. He reversed the crane on indication of the flagman. He got down from the crane and found IP lying on ground, profusely bleeding from leg. • As per the postmortem report, tyre marks were observed on IP’s thigh, establishing that the IP’s thigh was crushed by the Farana crane tyre. • The Farana crane operator had inadequate experience. His crane operating license was issued just 4 months before the incident. On the contrary, as per the skill assessment record, his experience as crane operator was mentioned as 3 years. Moreover, his training credentials were not as per the requirement of project specifications. • There were many incidents when noncompliance of safety rules was noted against the crane operator. The statements of the foreman of riggers and other crane operators depict that the crane operator was frequently violating safety norms and conducting unsafe acts. This Case Study is based on the Investigation report done by OISD and published for information purpose only. This information should be evaluated to determine if it is applicable in your operations, to avoid recurrence of such incidents.• Lifting and carrying of hook-loaded material by Farana crane was a regular practice. PMC had issued warning to contractor and its subcontractors against such activities. Fire & Safety group of occupier had also issued emails and given presentations depicting that unsafe act of pick and carry by Farana crane were being carried out. However, these unsafe acts were not being reported in the regular web-based reporting system of the refinery, neither were their closure evident. • The Lump-Sum Turn-Key (LSTK) contractor had developed a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for pick and carry activity by Farana. The SOP was not approved by Owner/ PMC. Following two points of SOP were worth noting: ➢ Farana shall not be used for long distance material shifting on the road. ➢ Two tag lines shall be used for, while shifting the material for shorter distance and nearest area. Long distance had not been defined. The Farana crane was being used for transporting around 200m. Moreover, only one tag line/ rigger was present at the time of incident. As informed the other rigger had left the refinery in the morning itself due to some urgency without informing the supervisor. • LSTK contractor had imposed penalty on 25 occasions on the concerned subcontractor in previous one year. HSE matters were left on PMC to handle. Occupier was not involved. • Project construction activities have been going on for 2.5 years. However, the area coverage in Internal Safety Audit (ISA) was not evident. No CCTV footage was available. PROBABLE REASON OF FAILURE / ROOT CAUSE • Inadequate experience of crane operator coupled with possibility of driving fast as they were getting late for lunch resulted in the accident. Furthermore, the trailer parked in the Farana crane movement path deviated the movement, leading to the accident. During left turn at junction followed by taking slight right due to the parked truck-trailer, the load might have swung and IP, being only rigger, could not handle the swinging load and fell in front of the Farana crane. • Shifting of hook loaded material for a long distance by Farana crane. • Though, the HSE policies and manuals were available but implementation at ground was lacking inspite of raising the deficiencies and cautioning by means of penalising. RECOMMENDATIONS • Vehicles/ trailers shall be parked in designated locations to prevent obstruction of other vehicle movement/ emergency vehicle movement. • Crane (inclusive of Farana/ Hydra) should not be used for transportation of hook loaded materials in line with Cl. 5.1.9 of OISD-GDN-192. • Two tag lines shall be used along with two riggers for material movement (only for short distance in exceptional conditions and the distance of movement permitted shall be clearly identified and documented with proper authorization). • Crane operators shall have minimum training in line with Project HSE document and procedure given in IS13583. Only experienced person shall be deployed for tasks involving skills. A robust mechanism should be developed for competency assessment before deployment. • Compliance to HSE related guidelines shall be ensured. Any deviation shall be brought to the notice of all concerned. Unsafe Acts/ unsafe conditions to be reported and tracked in addition to near misses. • Jobs shall be carried out with supervision and shall not be carried out during recess/ absence of adequate manpower. This Case Study is based on the Investigation report done by OISD and published for information purpose only. This information should be evaluated to determine if it is applicable in your operations, to avoid recurrence of such incidents.• CCTV shall be provided at strategic locations with adequate recording facilities. Footage shall be scrutinised/ Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to be adopted to identify unsafe acts/conditions and corrective measures taken thereof. • Appropriate corrective action shall be taken for deviations and penalties shall be imposed for repeat violation. Strict action shall be initiated after repeat penalties or not heeding to warnings. Organization should develop a zero-tolerance policy for operational lapses and fix responsibility on all persons responsible for the lapses and initiate departmental action against them. ************ This Case Study is based on the Investigation report done by OISD and published for information purpose only.

Fire in Atmospheric Vacuum Unit (AVU),Process (Crude Distillation Section) unit in refinery,,"CASE STUDY OISD/CS/2024-25/P&E/13 Dt.:14.1.2025 INTRODUCTION Title: Fire in Atmospheric Vacuum Unit (AVU). Location: Process (Crude Distillation Section) unit in refinery. Loss/ Outcome: Personnel injury, damage of equipment, unit outage & production loss. BRIEF OF INCIDENT: AVU was under startup after M&I. The Crude Distillation section was under hot circulation with furnace (4 parallel) coil outlet temperature at 320 o C and combined circulation rate of 700 m3/hr. The medium pressure (MP) steam, imported from battery limit, was routed through the convection section of the furnaces for super heating and subsequent usage as stripping steam. The steam, post convection section, was being vented through the silencer. The next activity was to route the super-heated steam to the stripping steam header for routing to the distillation columns/ strippers. Accordingly, the field operator was re-routing the steam from vent to the stripping steam header by closing the vent valve (V9- Refer FIG:1) and at the same time opening the main steam header valve (V8- Refer FIG:1), both located on the operating platform at approx.8.5m from grade. Upon diverting super-heated steam to steam header, a flash fire occurred at the vent of the crude furnace. One fire tender was already available in standby at CDU as per unit startup protocol. Fire fighting started immediately. A nearby remote operated “high-volume long-range monitor (HVLRM)” was used. Fire was extinguished within 12 minutes. Nine persons, who were involved in various startup activities in nearby area, sustained burn injuries. They were taken to refinery hospital and then were referred to other speciality hospitals. Fig 1: Schematic of MP Stripping Steam to Columns/ Strippers This Case Study is based on the Investigation report done by OISD and published for information purpose only. This information should be evaluated to determine if it is applicable in your operations, to avoid recurrence of such incidents.OBSERVATIONS / LAPSES 1. The pipe length from the valve (V8- Refer FIG:1), from where steam was being diverted to the stripping steam header that led to the stripping columns steam inlet control valves, was around 20M implying a hold up capacity of approximately 1.4 m3. Instead of first preparing the header and heating by means of venting/ draining till the point (V2- Refer FIG:1) nearest to location of process mixing, the diversion was attempted from distant location (V8- Refer FIG:1). 2. The above was also in contravention to the startup checklist illustrated in operating manual mentioning “Charge stripping steam to respective columns & strippers after draining condensate from the header and from upstream bleeders of column valves.” However, during interaction with multiple personnel (Manager & Senior Manager) in the production group, it was observed that the clarity about the introduction of stripping steam was absent. Further, the usage point valves (valves admitting steam to columns) were still closed, implying a blocked outlet condition. 3. The startup SOP did not explicitly cover about the steps of charging of steam stripping header, making the line condensate/ vapor (if any) free till the point nearest to the columns, and subsequently charging to the respective columns & strippers. The same was not covered in the AVU Shutdown Manual 2024 (CDU Startup activities) also. 4. Post incident, sample from drain points (V2- Refer FIG:1) of the stripping steam header was collected and sent to QC lab for testing. The reported density of hydrocarbon sample was 731.5 kg/m3 and the sample also contained 10% of free water. 5. Startup checklist illustrated in operating manual indicated to maintain 60% bottom level in pre- fractionator and then to subsequently introduce superheated steam. For other columns & strippers levels, nothing was mentioned. Bottom levels in all the columns/ strippers were considerably on higher side. Specifically heavy naphtha stripper and ATF stripper level were >100%. The actual levels could not be ascertained as the indicators were showing their maximum detection level. 6. Elevation of stripping steam nozzle of heavy naphtha stripper was 2M above the stripping steam diversion valve located at silencer platform indicating an equivalent static head. 7. After the incident, it was reported that heavy naphtha was observed in drain points of the stripping steam header at multiple locations. Reportedly, the 4’’ control valve bypass valve (V7- Refer FIG:1), 6’’ non-return valve (V3- Refer FIG:1). and 6’’ block valve (V1- Refer FIG:1) in the stripping steam line to heavy naphtha stripper were passing. Stripping steam lines to the other columns and strippers were reportedly checked after the incident, but no passing was observed in these valves. 8. It was informed that the non-return valves (i.e. V3- Refer FIG:1) in the stripping steam line to the columns had been replaced during the turnaround. The non-return valves had been tested prior to installation. 9. The startup clearance of the unit was given in spite of non-completion of various jobs in the unit like open manholes, mechanical scraps, non-readiness of fire protection facilities, unwanted scaffoldings, etc. The said pending jobs had been noted in the F&S checklist accompanying the startup clearance. It was also noticed that blinding and end cap provision of steam lines had not been considered in the operational readiness review done by operation, inspection, process, etc. This Case Study is based on the Investigation report done by OISD and published for information purpose only. This information should be evaluated to determine if it is applicable in your operations, to avoid recurrence of such incidents.CONCLUSION / ROOT CAUSE Source of Leak: Naphtha backed up from heavy naphtha stripper (11-C-3) due to passing of isolation valves and NRV in stripping steam circuit (V1, V3, V7- Refer FIG:1), possibly aided by high liquid level in the HN stripper. Hence, the stripping steam line up to the 6’’ diversion valve (V8- Refer FIG:1) located at silencer platform was already full of Naphtha before the 6’’ diversion valve for routing steam from vent to the stripping steam header was crack opened. The liquid naphtha, when came in contact with superheated steam (320oC) vaporized and discharged through the steam silencer (V9- Refer FIG:1) as in the downstream side, there was a blocked outlet condition. Source of Ignition: Auto ignition of Heavy Naphtha vapours (auto ignition temperature was 287.7oC as per the composition analysis) occurred. RECOMMENDATIONS a) SOP to be developed for charging of steam headers. The same shall be known to all the concerned operating personnel. b) Latest approved version of SOPs with a version number to be made available with proper access control to prevent duplication of SOPs as per 7.5.2.1 of working group report. Industry to make a system to ensure availability of controlled document to the working personnel. c) Industry shall ensure that all the concerned operating personnel strictly adhere to the operating parameters such as level, pressure, temperature etc. as stipulated in the operating manual/ IOW/ SOP/ Checklist. d) Necessary job/ role specific training to be provided to all personnel (including contract workers) including refresher training in line with Cl. 6.1 of OISD-STD-154. System to be developed to identify the personnel who have not undergone required trainings as per their job/ role. Structured “Competency assurance” program shall be developed in line with Cl. 7.2 of “Working Group” and necessary action to be taken. e) All construction and pre-commissioning related activities should be completed before commissioning of unit as stipulated in OISD-GDN-206. Industry to ensure all the stipulations mentioned in the startup clearance are completed with due diligence. Startup clearance shall be given only after completion of all the attributes mentioned in the PSSR. f) Industry shall ensure minimal manpower is deployed in process area during critical activities such as unit startup, shutdown, etc. g) Method to check such critical NRVs should be developed. Means should be explored for online checking of such NRVs. Installation of double NRV shall be reviewed in utility/ process interface circuit for enhancing system integrity. ************ This Case Study is based on the Investigation report done by OISD and published for information purpose only.

Explosion and major fire in benzene storage tanks,Refinery Loss/ Outcome: Two fatality and one injury BRIEF OF INCIDENT A sampler went for sampling in a benzene storage tank (capacity 1000 KL with actual material approx,,"CASE STUDY OISD/CS/2024-25/P&E/14 Dt.: 15/1/25 INTRODUCTION Title: Explosion and major fire in benzene storage tanks. Location: Refinery Loss/ Outcome: Two fatality and one injury BRIEF OF INCIDENT A sampler went for sampling in a benzene storage tank (capacity 1000 KL with actual material approx. 523 KL) after receipt of benzene. While the sampler was on top of the tank, an explosion and fire occurred, skyrocketing the fixed roof of the tank. The sampler body was found near the roof, that landed around 20 m away from the tank, just outside the dyke. Another benzene tank (capacity 400 KL with actual material approx. 48 KL) in the same dyke exploded about five hours later while the firefighting was in progress. The roof of the second tank landed around 160m away, on a tree and a parked vehicle, which was crushed. Where the second tank roof landed, a canteen worker fell unconscious and the Refinery Shift Manager suffered injuries. The canteen worker later succumbed. The fire was completely extinguished after about 10 hours of firefighting, with support of mutual aid partners. OBSERVATIONS / SHORTCOMINGS 1. In the SOP for sampling, relaxation time required between pumping/ receiving and sampling activity, which is required for low conductive liquids, (clause no.4.7 of OISD-RP-110) was not mentioned. 2. The sample device used in the incident was a SS cage (conductive) with a fibre rope (non- conductive), violating the requirements specified in clause no. 4.7 of OISD-RP-110. 3. Gaps with respect to requirements stated in latest OISD-STD-118 were observed in the dyke in which the affected tanks were located:  The dyke did not have roads on all four sides. Road was available only on one side (west) that too at a distance of about 45 m from the dyke and with pipeway in between. Further, during site visit, difficulty in approaching to the firefighting equipment due to improper access and the presence of pipelines was observed.  There were tanks in dyke on east side, north side as well as south side in contradiction with the stipulation of tanks layout to be in two rows only.  Diameter of three tanks out of the nine was exceeding more than 9 meters. No fire wall protection was existing to prevent spreading of spillages from any of the tank to other tanks in the same dyke. Provided for information purpose only. This information should be evaluated to determine if it is applicable in your operations, to avoid recurrence of such incidents. The total storage capacity was exceeding 5000 m3 in a single dyke.  Manifold of these tanks were inside the dyke. Further, earth pits were inside the dyke. 4. Being old tanks, none of the tanks including the affected tanks were equipped with inert gas blanketing. Furthermore, the tanks dip hatch lid was neither made from non-sparking material nor lined with non-sparking material. 5. Further, a goose neck vent with flame arrester was provided on the external fixed roof for in- breathing/ out-breathing of the tanks. Design documents of the tanks could not be traced. Hence, it could not be verified whether the goose neck was designed for fire case or not. Also, no adequacy calculation was available. 6. The tanks were bonded and grounded with two earthing connections and the last measured earthing resistance was reported and found within the limits. The earthing resistance check was due in another three days from the day of incident. Moreover earthing & bonding effectiveness on the day of incident could not be guaranteed. 7. An interruption of foam application during firefighting was informally informed, which resulted in eruption of pockets of pool fire across the dyke at several places wherever the foam was breaking, and it was more intense near the second tank which resulted in the explosion. 8. No training record with respect to sample collection methodology and the associated risks was evident. 9. Additionally, no competency requirement except educational qualification of standard 8th/SSC was mentioned in the sampler’s contract, which specified for assistance in material transfer, hydrocarbon and crude sampling, etc. under semi-skilled manpower supply category. 10. Awareness level of the hazards and potential dangers from the flammable carcinogenic material, Benzene, was observed to be inadequate when interacted with another sampler. 11. During the review of alarm’s history/ activation of gas detectors, it was found that all five benzene detectors (in the dyke area) were activated and triggered high-high alarm after around 25 minutes of incident, indicating that the benzene concentration at ground level increased to alarming level quite after the incident. Hence, it also rules out the possibility of benzene spread due to open valves or leakages at ground level. 12. There was no practice of periodic inspection of internal floating deck of the tank, though there is a requirement for inspection of floating deck of internal floating roof tanks as per clause no. 5.2 of OISD-STD-129. In absence of such inspection, potential seal failure, de-floating of deck, etc. may result in ingress of hydrocarbon into the vapor head space between the floating roof deck and the fixed roof. REASONS OF FAILURE / ROOT CAUSE The first explosion was caused by the confined vapor cloud explosion between the floating roof deck and the fixed roof ignited most likely by spark emanating from the dip hatch lid (non-spark proof) or the discharge of static charge of benzene liquid (accumulated during the receipt of material) at the time of sampling activity. The second explosion occurred due to boiling of material in the second tank, aggravated during the foam application interruption at the incident site. Provided for information purpose only. This information should be evaluated to determine if it is applicable in your operations, to avoid recurrence of such incidents.RECOMMENDATIONS 1. Provision of alternate sampling point other than from tank top to be explored, particularly in all low conductivity hydrocarbons. 2. Gauge hatch shall be non-sparking (or lined with non-sparking material) and self-closing type as per clause no. 4.10 of OISD-STD-108. 3. Prevention of static charge build-up and discharge:  Sampling and gauging devices shall be either completely conductive or completely nonconductive. Conductive sampling and gauging devices shall not be used with a nonconductive lowering device like cable, dry clean natural fiber rope etc. as specified in clause no. 4.7 of OISD-RP-110.  Extra precautions – beyond normal bonding and grounding – should be explored for handling, transferring, and storing low-conductive flammable liquids.  Review the effectiveness of conductive equipment/ earthing system associated with low- conductive flammable liquids on quarterly basis.  The flow velocity shall be restricted to the limits specified in clause no. 4.5.1 & Appendix-C of OISD-RP-110 during transfer/ filling operations for static accumulator fluids.  Testing of conductivity of material at supply location should be conducted and the same shall be specified in the test report along with a message of caution.  Conductivity testing/ analysis and reporting shall be ensured at all stages of transfer of such fluids. MSDS should also cover all relevant aspects.  Anti-static additives may be added to increase conductivity.  A static electricity dissipation study may be conducted to ascertain the relaxation time for known non-conductive flammable liquids. 4. Gap analysis with respect to OISD-STD-118 shall be carried out and necessary corrective measures shall be ensured. 5. Nitrogen blanketing for internal floating roof tanks/ fixed roof tanks should be considered for storing products like benzene, etc. as per clause no. 4.4 of OISD-STD-108. 6. A procedure for periodic inspection of floating deck of internal floating roof tanks in line with clause no. 5.2 of OISD-STD-129 should be developed. Necessary precautions required during such inspections should be included in the procedures. 7. Gap analysis of existing contract management system, particularly with respect to educational qualification, experience and training requirements, to be carried out with reference to clause 7.3 of Working Group Report and shall be specified in all contracts. 8. Appropriate training shall be imparted to all concerned, including contract workers in line with OISD-STD-154. Records should be maintained for all employees & contractual workers along with a list of personnel who are due for initial/ refresher training. 9. SOP of sampling shall be reviewed. Specific SOP shall be developed for sampling of critical products. All personnel should be sensitized about the relevant hazards and related SOPs. 10. The efficacy of firefighting facilities considering difficult scenarios, double contingencies, critical identified areas, difficulty in approaching, etc. shall be verified periodically through mock-drills. 11. Wherever design documents of storage tanks are unavailable, adequacy of safety features should be established. Provided for information purpose only. This information should be evaluated to determine if it is applicable in your operations, to avoid recurrence of such incidents.PHOTOGRAPHS Figure 1: Dome of the first exploded tank, outside the dyke.

Naphtha Splitter Reboiler Furnace Fire Incident,Refinery Loss/ Outcome: Property Damage BRIEF OF INCIDENT Fire incident occurred in the furnace of Naphtha Splitter (Part of Isomerization Unit),31/01/2025,"CASE STUDY OISD/CS/2024-25/P&E/16 Dt.: 31/01/2025 INTRODUCTION Title: Naphtha Splitter Reboiler Furnace Fire Incident. Location: Refinery Loss/ Outcome: Property Damage BRIEF OF INCIDENT Fire incident occurred in the furnace of Naphtha Splitter (Part of Isomerization Unit). The Refinery’s operating team and fire personnel responded immediately, and the fire was extinguished in about 22 minutes. There were no injuries/casualties due to the incident. Site Photographs Provided for information purpose only. This information should be evaluated to determine if it is applicable in your operations, to avoid recurrence of such incidents.OBSERVATIONS / SHORTCOMINGS 1. As per Licenser feed specification, Naphtha Splitter column was designed for three wide range naphtha streams, however one stream from AU-1 was also routed to column. Management of change was not evident for the change in feed streams, neither was there any vetting from the licensor. 2. The furnace was offered for inspection in year 2015. Inspection report inference regarding no thickness loss and satisfactory tubes external surface seemed to be contradictory to its own statement of thick scaling on external surface. Further, values of tube thickness obtained was not mentioned in the report neither was the thickness survey technique adopted or the tool utilised. 3. ISOM unit shutdown was taken in year 2021 for maintenance job. When manhole of the furnace was opened for inspection, smell of naphtha was detected. After extensive thickness gauging of the complete radiation tubes, convective return bends and convection shock tubes, 55 number of furnace tubes and fittings were replaced during the shutdown. 4. The studded convection tubes above the shock tubes were not inspected because of approach problem. 5. Inspite of heavy corrosion in Naphtha Splitter reboiler furnace tubes after 2021, enhanced monitoring/ testing, particularly with respect to Sulphur & Moisture, of Naphtha Splitter feed quality was not evident. 6. Naphtha Splitter reboiler furnace tripped at low column bottom level due to very high feed moisture in Jan’23, but no root cause analysis was evident for the process upset. 7. MOC was raised for installation of coalescer along with pre-filter upstream of Naphtha Splitter feed surge drum to handle feed moisture problem. However, no further action on the MOC was evident. 8. The residual life calculation subsequent from 2021 was not in-line with OISD-STD-133. 9. On the day of incident at 17:16 hrs, furnace tripped on fire box pressure high and at the same time black smoke observed in CCTV footage. 10. Fire was extinguished at 17:39 hrs, after extinguishing the fire, cooling operation was continued till 17:53 hrs. 11. Later Naphtha leakage was noticed from convection section tube. The concerned tube thickness was not checked in year 2021 shutdown. REASONS OF FAILURE / ROOT CAUSE Fire in the furnace was result of naphtha leakage from the Naphtha Splitter reboiler convection bank tube. Failure of tube in convection section led to leakage of naphtha and resultant fire in reboiler furnace. The naphtha (class-A hydrocarbon) caught fire due to the high temperature (around 720oC in arch) in the furnace. Tube failure can be attributed to high rate of corrosion. RECOMMENDATIONS 1. MOC system in line with OISD-STD-178 to be followed for all changes. Further, any scheme raised in MOC system should be drawn to its proper conclusion. The same shall be pursued or dropped (with proper reasoning) in a time-bound manner. 2. Inspection report shall include all the observations in details like thickness reading, observation, thickness measurement techniques/ tool used, measuring equipment details with calibration date, recommendations, exclusions (areas not covered), etc. Studded tubes shall also be inspected in line with OISD-STD-133. 3. The monitoring of critical parameters, feed quality, etc. should be strengthened/ frequency increased for known failure cases. 4. API standard 530 shall be used to calculate remaining life of heater tubes as stipulated in clause no 10.2.4 of OISD-STD-133. Corrosion rate shall be determined separately for each pass and accordingly remaining life shall be calculated. 5. Process trip incidences should be properly investigated and record to be maintained in line with clause no 7.4.13.1 of Working Group Recommendations. 6. Shut Down planning of units shall be decided based on the health of the critical equipment and activities shall be taken up accordingly. Provided for information purpose only. This information should be evaluated to determine if it is applicable in your operations, to avoid recurrence of such incidents."
Fatal accident during adsorbent removal,Petrochemical Complex Loss/ Outcome: 2 fatalities,29/03/2024,"CASE STUDY OISD/CS/2024-25/P&E/01 Dt.:29/03/2024 INTRODUCTION Title: Fatal accident during adsorbent removal. Location: Petrochemical Complex Loss/ Outcome: 2 fatalities. BRIEF OF INCIDENT: Two contract workers, employed by a catalyst loading/unloading agency, were working inside the chloride guard vessel of Ethylene Recovery Unit, trying to extract the caked-up adsorbent of the chloride guard under the confined space entry permit. A sudden eruption occurred in the vessel, resulting in the fatality of both workers. OBSERVATIONS/ SHORTCOMINGS 1. The chloride guard vessel had been commissioned about a month ago. 2. The pressure drop across the chloride guard was observed to be increasing since commissioning, reaching a peak of 3 kg/cm2 against a normal of 0.2 kg/cm2 in about a fortnight. 3. On analysis, it was suspected with water carry-over from wash water section might be the cause of increased pressure drop. The increase pressure drop was also correlated to the high level in the upstream column. 4. Due to the constrained operation caused by high delta pressure, the chloride guard vessel was taken offline and unloading of adsorbent through vacuuming was initiated by opening the top manhole after the required purging and necessary clearance & job safety analysis (JSA). 5. Plant Air (PA) supply through a ¾” hose had been connected to a flange of the bottom drain point of the vessel after nitrogen purging of the vessel. 6. However, removal by vacuuming could not be continued after removal of top material (ceramic balls, etc.) due to observed caking of the adsorbent. Therefore, it was decided to take out the adsorbent manually. The JSA was reviewed. The bottom manhole was in closed condition, in deviation to JSA recommendation. 7. Two contract workers, equipped with airline masks, entered the vessel with buckets for the manual removal job after getting the man-entry permit. Two contract workers were on the platform top to pull the buckets out. 8. The air was in charged condition from the temporary bottom connection. The contract workers at the top were monitoring the gas condition inside the vessel (H S, CO, LEL and O ). 2 2 9. Checking of pressure gauge at the bottom of the vessel, before or during the man-entry, could not be corroborated. 10. Reportedly, within about half an hour, a sudden eruption sound with spray of catalyst beads/ dust gushing out from the reactor top manhole was observed. The beads/ dust kept coming for about 10- 15 seconds projecting to a height of 5-6 meters spreading all around the nearby area. This Case study is based on the Investigation report submitted by committee and published for information purpose only. This information should be evaluated to determine if it is applicable in your operations, to avoid recurrence of such incidents.11. One contract worker died inside the vessel while the other, who was pulled out, succumbed to his injuries after some time. 12. CCTV cameras were installed, but no historical data was available although its operationalization before commissioning had been recommended in PCSA of the unit. CONCLUSION / ROOT CAUSE The plant air supply, connected to the reactor through the hose with flanged connection, might not have passed through caked adsorbent bed (caked due to probable moisture absorption). Consequently, the empty space below the adsorbent bed must have pressurized. This trapped air eventually erupted. The plant air header pressure dropped momentarily at the incident time, suggesting a release of airflow restriction. The trigger for the air release could be: a) During bucketing, the caked catalyst crust holding the pressure below may have thinned/broken, suddenly releasing pressure and causing adsorbent/inert balls to fly as projectiles. b) Alternatively, incomplete hydrocarbon removal during purging could have led to a localized explosion if ignited, fracturing the lump and releasing air carrying adsorbent pellets at high velocity. While ignition cannot be entirely ruled out, there was no concrete evidence of burning or soot found. RECOMMENDATIONS a) No connection shall be made to a confined space during man-entry that may pressurize or create any hazard in the confined space. b) When vessel is purged for vessel entry, the air or nitrogen connection shall be equipped with a flow regulator containing an excess pressure release mechanism. Manual air pressurization checks can be done by closing the supply for a while and checking the time taken for release of pressure. c) Perform Job Safety Analysis (JSA) with a diverse team, including contract personnel, if applicable, to assist in envisaging all sorts of safety aspects and thereby addressing them. Deviations, if any, should be deliberated again for taking alternative measures. d) Supervise catalyst loading/unloading activities in running process unit closely in person or using CCTV. Moreover, CCTV should be strategically placed to cover most of the process units. History data for the CCTV footage should be configured. Pre-Commissioning Safety Audit (PCSA) recommendations shall be implemented before commissioning. e) Integrity Operating Window (IOW) for critical parameters and deviations from the IOW shall be investigated properly and corrective measures shall be taken accordingly. f) Hierarchy of hazard control, i.e. elimination, substitution, engineering controls, administrative controls, and use of PPE, shall be followed while addressing a risk. Hence, incorporating engineering controls like de-entrainment separators in case of susceptibility of downstream equipment/ material to any carryover of material from upstream, provision of differential pressure indicator across adsorbent/ catalyst beds, etc. should be contemplated. ************ This Case study is based on the Investigation report submitted by committee and published for information purpose only.

,POL TERMINAL Loss/ Outcome: Two (2) nos,,"CASE STUDY OISD/CS/2024-25/MOPOL/06 Date: 06/06/2024 (A) INTRODUCTION Title : Explosion of the Ethanol Above Ground Horizontal Tanks – 2 nos. Location: POL TERMINAL Loss/ Outcome: Two (2) nos. of fatality. (B) DETAILS OF INCIDENT : Location wanted to convert the two A/G (above ground) horizontal tanks of 70 KL cap. each 3m dia. x 11m length from Ethanol to Slop service. An A/G sump tank, also referred as OWS is located very close to the tank dyke. A HWP was issued to the contractor for the modification of common inlet header of Ethanol tanks for the said conversion. Accordingly, six contract workmen arrived at the worksite two Oxygen cylinders, one LPG cylinder, few pipe sections, elbows, welding rectifier machine, welding electrodes, grinding machine, Gas cutting torch, torch ignition lighter, face shield mask, electrical JB, a bunch of electrical cable and some other material. Flanges on the common Ethanol Inlet header of both the tanks were opened. Two buckets were kept under these open flanges for the collection and disposal of Pipeline content in the adjoining A/G sump tank. Workers also tried to open the nut bolts of the upstream flange joint of the inlet MOV of one of the tank but it could not be opened as the same were rusted. They opened the downstream flange of the same MOV. Further, this inlet MOV was also Half Opened. This might have been done to empty out the balance Ethanol from the tank before opening the flanges. For the 2nd tank, workers opened the upstream flange joint of its inlet MOV. This MOV was kept closed. This tank had approx. 20KL Ethanol. Two loud explosions occurred on these tanks along with fire as seen in the CCTV footage. One of the contract worker suffered severe burn injuries and could not come out of the work spot. He was declared brought dead when he was taken to the hospital. Another worker could escape from the affected area. He ran towards main gate of the Installation and was immediately rushed to hospital for treatment. He had suffered approx. 40% to 50% burn injuries. Subsequently, he succumbed to the burn injuries after one month of the incident. Terminal team reached the incident site within 3 to 3.5 min. and started fire-fighting operation. Fire was extinguished within next 7 to 8 min. Total time to extinguish the fire was approx. 10 ~ 12 min. after the explosions. Provided for information purpose only. This information should be evaluated to determine if it is applicable in your operations, to avoid recurrence of such incidents.Both the Ethanol tanks after the explosion & fire. Both the end dish of left side tank flew away. Inlet dish of right side tank ruptured and fell on the dyke wall. Pipe Alley outside the dyke of Ethanol tanks Various material viz. Buket, Grinding Machine, Welding Rectifier, Elbows, Pipe section, Electrical JB, Cables etc. at Worksite. Provided for information purpose only. This information should be evaluated to determine if it is applicable in your operations, to avoid recurrence of such incidents.(C) OBSERVATIONS & LAPSES: a) Deviation from Procedure / Non availability of MOC (Management of Change) document: MOC document having the new P&ID/ Scheme / Sketch with requisite details was not prepared for this modification. Details of the work to be done and procedure to be adopted for the said conversion was not prepared. Improper planning without any discussion and understanding the requirements of the job like sequencing of various activities viz. Isolation of tanks, emptying out the dead stock and degassing of tanks was not done before carrying out the hot work. b) Non Compliance of Work Permit System : Hot work permit (HWP) with JSA was issued to the contractor”. However, following was noted from the Permit and site interaction of the Investigating team with workers and officials of OMC: • HWP was approved & issued using the SAP ID & password of Location In charge (LIC), who was on leave on the day of incident. • Tank no. of only one of the tank was mentioned on the HWP whereas the Ethanol Inlet header, which was supposed to be modified, was common for both the Ethanol tanks. • It is not clear from the permit whether the person who has requested for the issuance of permit and Receiver of the permit are the same or different. Further, there is no space for the Receiver of Permit after the issuance of permit, which is not in line with the sample format of HWP as per Annexure-I of OISD-STD- 105. c) Loose handling of Class-A product: All content of the Ethanol inlet header was drained & collected in the buckets and then the same was poured in the OWS / sump tank. This loose handling of the class-A product led to vapour accumulation at the worksite which ultimately led to fire & explosion of the tanks. d) Hydrocarbon (H/C) free tanks: Process of emptying out the Ethanol from the tanks and making it gas free was not ensured before starting the hot work at site. This led to rich & explosive mixture inside the tanks. This was also one of the main reason for the explosion and fire of the tanks. e) Lack of Supervision / Job knowledge of the Company Personnel & Contractor Supervisor : Hazard identification, Risk Assessment, Approval & Issuance of Hot Work Permit & JSA was done by the Maintenance officer, without visiting the site on the day of incident as there is no evidence of the same. He did not brief the Contractor supervisor about the hazards associated with the job and control measures to be taken at site. Toolbox talk was also not carried out. There is no record of the same. Further, JSA recommendations was also not followed by the contractor. One of the requirement of JSA i.e. LEL checking at regular intervals by the Permit Receiver was mentioned as “Yes”. However, LEL reading has been noted as “0” only once before starting the job but there is no record of the same afterwards. f) No replacement of DSO (Designated Safety Officer): DSO of the location was on planned medical leave. However, no one else at the installation was designated as DSO in his place. g) Non-functional HCDs: HCDs were nonfunctional at the time of incident due to flooding of the location. Further, it is not mentioned in the records of the Installation even though LIC and other officers were aware of the same. Proper mitigation measures not taken to neutralize the effects of non-functional HCDs. (D) PROBABLE REASONS OF FAILURE / ROOT CAUSE / CONCLUSION: a) Investigating team has concluded that in order to modify the common inlet header of the Ethanol tanks, flanges of the same were opened, pipeline content was collected in buckets and it was poured into the adjoining A/G open sump. This might have led to the accumulation and spread of Ethanol vapour at the worksite. When one of the contract workman might have attempted to ignite the gas cutting torch to cut the nuts & bolts, the accumulated vapours at the worksite immediately caught fire. This flame might have travelled up to inside the left side tank through the open inlet header and its half open Inlet MOV. Provided for information purpose only. This information should be evaluated to determine if it is applicable in your operations, to avoid recurrence of such incidents.b) Since there was a dead stock of approx. 1.4 KL in this tank and it was full of rich vapors, the flame caused explosion of the same. Intensity of the explosion was such that both dish ends of this tank were blown away approx. 24 & 30m respectively. Residue product of tank spilled in the dyke, resulting into pool fire there. Explosion in the first tank and fire in the dyke area might have caused heating up of adjacent tank, resulting c) in rise of its internal pressure and consequently its explosion & rupture. Inlet side dish of this tank fell inside the dyke area due to its rupture. (E) RECOMMENDATIONS: Following corrective actions are recommended to avoid recurrence of such / similar incidents: a) Preparation of MOC : MOC having the new P&ID/ Sketch with requisite details shall be prepared & approved for any modification & change of service of tanks prior to executing the same as per clause no. 4.i) of OISD-STD-178 Detail discussions, analysis and planning shall be done including understanding the requirements of job and sequencing of the same based on the MOC and P&ID before executing the same. b) Work Permit System : Strict adherence to work permit system as per OISD-STD-105 shall be ensured including: • Work permit shall be filled up accurately ensuring detailed and providing complete information in all sections/ sub sections in line with site conditions, risk assessment and safety requirements of the job. Sketches should be attached wherever possible to avoid any kind of miscommunication, as per clause no. 6.4.2 of OISD-STD-105. • Hazard identification and risk analysis (HIRA) of the job shall be done as per clause no. 6.1 of OISD-GDN- 206. Accordingly, a careful JSA shall be done based on the same to determine the appropriate safeguards before starting the work as per clause no. 6.3.1 of OISD-STD-105. • JSA shall also prescribe the frequency of the gas test (continuous detection using portable gas detectors or hourly or after every shift) as per clause no. 6.3.1.viii) and the same shall be complied. • No one shall share his / her SAP ID & Password with others (including LIC / Permit issuer and Receiver) for the Permit related jobs or otherwise. • Overall, Work Permit system shall be completely aligned with OISD-STD-105 including the format of HWP as per Annexure-I of OISD-STD-105. c) Loose handling of the Product: It shall never be done at any installation or any worksite. d) Hydrocarbon (H/C) free tanks: Tanks & worksite shall be made gas-free or positive isolation of the same shall be ensured before carrying out any hot work at the installations. e) Effective Supervision of works including Toolbox talks: Toolbox talk coupled with proper supervision shall be ensured depending on the nature of work as per clause no. 6.3.3. of OISD-STD-105. The work shall not be allowed without proper supervision. f) Deployment of alternate DSO: Alternate DSO shall be given the charge in case of non-availability of regular DSO due to his leave or other official engagements. g) Hydrocarbon Detectors (HCDs) : Periodic checking of Safety Critical Equipment (SCE) e.g. PSVs, ESDs, HCDs etc. and their healthiness should be ensured and documented. Any deviation/ non availability/ impairment should be duly logged, approved and communicated to all concerned with alternate mitigation measures/ course of action as per clause no. 7.6.8.c) of OISD-GDN-206. SCE which are not available/ by pass should be marked in field also. ==============================X=================================== Provided for information purpose only.

,POL Depot Loss/ Outcome: The overflown HSD reached the internal stormwater drain and the municipal drain outside the depot premises,,"CASE STUDY OISD/CS/2025-26/MOPOL/01 Date: 02/04/2025 (A) INTRODUCTION Title : HSD overflow from underground tank Location: POL Depot Loss/ Outcome: The overflown HSD reached the internal stormwater drain and the municipal drain outside the depot premises. (B) DETAILS OF INCIDENT: The location has 2 nos. HSD tanks i.e. one underground tank of 180 Kl (say-TK01) and one HSD tank of 4800 KL (Say- TK08). Location receives HSD product from tank wagons only. On the date of incident i.e. 04.12.2024, a wagon rake consisting of 9 MS TWs and 16 HSD TWs was placed for unloading. After completion of rake receipt, AG tank TK01 was operated for tank truck loading at approx. 1245 hrs. by switching it to “Dispatch TTL” mode i.e. TT loading mode. Approx. after one hour, underground tank no. 8 was lined up for receipt of product through inter tank transfer from TK01 in “Receipt TTL” mode i.e. TT receipt mode. One manual hand operated valve was opened on the TK01 delivery line to facilitate simultaneous TT loading at TLFG and transfer of product to underground tank TK08. During the transfer of product, UG tank No. 8 overflowed at 1515 hrs. The overflow continued for 13 minutes i.e. till 15:28 hrs. According to the depot officials, the inter tank transfer from above ground tank to underground tank was being done for testing of HHH alarms of UG tanks physically, and the overflow occurred during this activity. The underground tank farm was enclosed by a kerb wall and the kerb wall had holes. The overflowed product drained through holes in the kerb wall and reached to the internal storm water drain near UG tanks kerb wall and the municipal drain outside the location adjacent to the boundary wall. The distance between UG tank farm kerb wall to the boundary wall towards north was 4.7 meters. At 1502 hrs, High Level alarm in TK08 generated at its defined level which was 318.0. At the same time, High level alarm was acknowledged. However, details of the person acknowledged the alarm was not traceable in automation system. Provided for information purpose only. This information should be evaluated to determine if it is applicable in your operations, to avoid recurrence of such incidents.(Bird’s- eye view of location) (Facilities at location) (C) OBSERVATIONS & LAPSES: Location was carrying out two operations simultaneously i.e. tank truck loading and product transfer to UG tank from the same tank (i.e. AG tank no TK01). The SOPs, P&ID and FDS of location was reviewed and observations area as under: I. As per the SOP for HSD product transfer from the above-ground tank to the underground tank, the manually operated valve at the suction of the product pump was required to be kept closed. Hence, tank truck loading was not permitted while the product transfer was taking place. However, before inter-tank transfer, this valve was not closed, and tank truck loading was allowed simultaneously with the product transfer. This is a violation of SOP for transferring the product from above ground to underground storage tank. Provided for information purpose only. This information should be evaluated to determine if it is applicable in your operations, to avoid recurrence of such incidents.II. As per SOP for product transfer from above ground to underground tanks, the levels of the tank to be monitored continuously from the control room and once the operation is complete, all the valves to be closed. However, continuous monitoring of the levels from control room was not done. During the incident, the control room was not manned by location officials. This is a violation of SOP for product transfer from above ground tank to underground tank III. As reported by location, the incident occurred during testing of HHH alarm of UG tank no TK8 by physically transferring the product to the underground tank. As per SOP of control room operations and FDS of location, the HHH alarm conditions on above ground tanks shall be simulated through proof test command. Therefore, testing the HHH alarms of UG tanks by physically transferring the product instead of using proof testing via simulation is a violation of both i.e. SOP and the Functional Design Specification (FDS). (a) Violation of Internal guidelines/ circulars: As per company internal circular and guidelines, operation in any tank above-ground or underground, shall be carried out only after putting the tanks in appropriate tank mode. It was observed that the correct modes for product transfer, i.e., 'inter-tank dispatch mode' for TK01 and 'inter-tank receipt mode' for TK08, were not selected during the ITT operation of TK1 & TK8. Instead, TK1 was set to 'tank truck dispatch' mode, and TK8 was set to 'tank truck receipt' mode. This is a violation of the internal circular guidelines. (b) Deviation from Functional Design Specification (FDS): I. As per the FDS, the hand-operated valves installed at the pump house suction header and at the delivery line of the aboveground tank were to be equipped with position sensors to monitor the status of these valves in the terminal automation system. However, the position sensors on the hand-operated valves were not actually provided. Had the position sensors been installed on the HOVs provided at the delivery line of the aboveground tank (TK01), the status of position sensors in automation system would have prevented the AG tank and UG to be put in TT dispatch and TT receipt mode respectively. The terminal automation system's equipment/functionality not aligning with the FDS constituted a violation of the FDS. II. From the TAS alarm logs, the identity of the user who acknowledged the H alarm generated at approx. 1503 hrs was not available in the system. It was noted that the alarm set time, and the alarm acknowledged time was exactly same. Due to some system settings or system malfunctioning, all such alarms were being acknowledged automatically by the system, rather than by the user. The alarms were not being acknowledged by the user, this is a violation of alarm and event management of Functional Design Specifications. (c) Servo Gauge on UG Tanks: I. All the underground tanks have been provided with a Honeywell Enraf Servo Gauge (Model: 954 Smart Servo Flexline HP). This gauge measures both dip level and product density. Location sought the Technical Clarification on Servo Functionality from OEM i.e. M/s Honeywell Automation India Limited. The working philosophy of Servo Gauge explained by the OEM is as under: “When the Servo Gauge is measuring the product level, the displacer always rests on the product surface to follow the product level. When the servo-density command is activated (i.e. the gauge is activated for density scanning mode and paused the Product Level Provided for information purpose only. This information should be evaluated to determine if it is applicable in your operations, to avoid recurrence of such incidents.Measuring mode) then the displacer starts to move downward to complete the tank profile density scan and returned to the product surface after completion of density scan to activate automatically the product Level measurement mode. The servo gauge may take between 20 and 60 minutes to calculate the density measurement in one cycle, depending on the product depth, tank height, and the configured number of density points for the tank profile density scan at the time of the density activation command. During the servo-density scanning period, the TFMS software holds the last valid product level value as stored value.” (Working philosophy of Servo Gauge provided by OEM is enclosed as “Annexure-VII”) Location officials were aware of this functionality. The possible causes of HSD overflow from underground tank during product transfer from above ground to underground tank are as follows: Case I : As informed by the location, they had scheduled the density measurement time at 1500 hrs for all UG tanks. During the period between 15:03:12 hrs and 15:33:34 hrs, the displace would have moved downward to scan the density and thus would not have updated the levels. This likely led to the latching of the dip level at 322.1 CMs in UG Tank TK8 between 15:03:12 and 15:33:34 hrs, preventing the HH and HHH alarms from triggering, which would have resulted in an overflow and spillage of HSD. Case II: According to the reply submitted by OMC in response to the questions raised in Parliament, the product overflow from the dip hatch of underground tank happened due to malfunctioning of servo gauge and in turn over fill protection system. II. Independent level Switch: No hard-wired independent level switch was available on UG tanks. Only one servo gauge was available on the tank. (d) CCTV Monitoring: I. The location has installed CCTV monitoring systems at three places: the control room, security cabin, and the location in-charge's room. However, the CCTV was not being monitored at any of these locations, and the overflow incident continued to happen for approx. 13 minutes, and nobody noticed the incident through CCTV system. II. The overflow incident was captured by the CCTV camera 'Near UG Tank Roadside Perimeter.' However, the view of the CCTV camera was obstructed by a tree inside the location, and the intended area, i.e., the perimeter, was not effectively visible. The tertiary containment valve facility was covered by the 'Transformer Yard Perimeter Camera,' but the view from this camera was also obstructed by tree branches. A CCTV (PTZ) camera installed to cover the HSD TK-08 dyke area had been out of service since April 2024. III. CCTV monitoring was provided in the control room, but it was positioned opposite the TAS display screens, at the back side of the Control room In-charge seating position. This setup makes it difficult to monitor the CCTV system, as it can only be accessed intentionally. The display was not positioned at location where the continuous monitoring can be done. Provided for information purpose only. This information should be evaluated to determine if it is applicable in your operations, to avoid recurrence of such incidents.(e) Drainage system: I. The kerb wall of the UG tank farm had three holes towards storm water drain. It was observed that the overflowed product seeped out of the kerb wall thru the holes. Location officials didn’t notice the same during daily safety inspections and didn’t record the same under unsafe conditions. II. On the north side, the basement of the boundary wall was constructed with random rubble masonry. The overflowed product would have percolated through the loose sand, crossing the boundary wall via the RR masonry foundation, and reached the outside drain running parallel to the boundary wall. Oil-soaked soil was observed between the kerb wall and the boundary wall. III. The drain in the UG tank kerb wall area was provided. However, the slope of UG tank farm was towards north side whereas the existing drain was provided at southwest side and was directed towards ETP. The inlet of the drainpipe was approx. 80 mm above the dyke floor. The provided drainage was not effective, and this deviation was not recorded by location during routine inspection and maintenance and during the internal audits. ETP Routing Pipe above Ground level IV. There was a stormwater drain within the location that leads outside through the tertiary containment valves. A sluice gate was not provided in the stormwater drain at the tertiary containment, only gate valves inside the pit were installed. The storm water drain was connected to the outside drain through these gate valves. During investigation, it was observed that one of the gate valves was leaking even when in the closed position. Non availability of sluice gate on tertiary containment is a violation of cl. 6.4.2 (f) of OISD-STD- 244. Provided for information purpose only. This information should be evaluated to determine if it is applicable in your operations, to avoid recurrence of such incidents.(f) Safety Audits: Last multi-disciplinary safety audit (ISA) of the location was carried out in March’24. There was total 32 nos. recommendations. Upon reviewing the last MDSA report, no recommendations were found regarding the holes in the underground (UG) tank kerb walls and the drainage of the underground tank farm area. Due to limited storage capacity, no ESA of the depot was conducted by OISD. (D) RECOMMENDATIONS: Following corrective actions are recommended to avoid recurrence of such incidents: (a) Strict Adherence to SOPs, internal guidelines/ circulars and FDS:  Approved Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) shall be strictly adhered to for all operations. The location shall ensure the operation of hand-operated valves in accordance with the valve sequence specified in the SOP for all operations.  As outlined in the SOP, the levels of the tanks shall be continuously monitored from the control room during the transfer of product from the A/G tank to the U/G tank. All operations shall be carried out under the supervision of a responsible officer (Refer to Clause 8.2 (vi) of OISD-STD- 244).  HHH alarm testing and interlock checking shall be performed using the proof test method, as per the approved SOP & FDS.  Location shall ensure that operation in any tank, A/G or U/G, shall be carried out only after putting the tanks in appropriate tank mode.

"Fatal Fire incident in Heater Treater Location: Onshore location, GGS","Onshore location, GGS",,"CASE STUDY OISD/CS/2024-25/E&P/17 Dt.: 11.03.2025 INTRODUCTION Title: Fatal Fire incident in Heater Treater Location: Onshore location, GGS. Loss/ Outcome: Loss of human life & other damages due to fire. BRIEF OF INCIDENT: On January 7, 2025, HT(Heater Treater)-3 was shut down for PSV calibration job. Later, HT-3 start up was initiated prior to completion of PSV (Pressure Safety Valve) installation, while PSV team was preparing for PSV installation. Around 15:20 hrs, crude oil began overflowing from the open flange of the PSV of HT-3. The fire was noticed shortly after the above incident in HT-3 area. One person got engulfed in the fire and rushed to medical college but declared dead. The fire team along with the fire tender reported at site at around 15:22 hrs and the fire was extinguished by 15:40 hrs and cooling down was initiated and site was declared all clear by 17:00 hrs. OBSERVATIONS/ SHORTCOMINGS 1. The feeding of crude to HT-3 was through RC 1 Pump. HT-3 and RC 1 were stopped for PSV calibration. Later, Pump RC-1 was started without ensuring the installation of PSV on HT-3. 2. JSA was prepared highlighting general hazards and precautions of PSV calibration. The following points of the JSA were not complied with. a. Depressurize the vessel and empty it before taking up the job. b. Only remove the PSV after the vessel is depressurized. c. Take the vessel in line only after fixing the PSV and observe for any abnormality. No record of Heater Treater HT-3, level or details of valves closed were found. No evidence of positive isolation of HT-3 was found. 3. Permit to Work (PTW) was created for the general job of PSV calibration at GGS, also it was not an approved PTW. Also, the maintenance team took up some routine maintenance job on the pump RC-1 but no Work Permit was found for the same. The pump was locally locked out by blocking on / off switch. No record of lock out / tag out (LOTO) found. 4. No record of Heater Treater HT-3, level or details of valves closed were found. No evidence of positive isolation of HT-3 was found. This Case study is based on the Investigation report submitted by committee and published for information purpose only. This information should be evaluated to determine if it is applicable in your operations, to avoid recurrence of such incidents.5. No record of safety briefing provided to the PSV calibration team prior to start of the job was found. Also, no safety Briefing was given to OISD accident investigation team at the time of entering the installation. 6. As per the contract, following violations were noticed. a. MVT records of contractual persons were not available. b. Valid Competency Certificates of the competent person(s) were not found. c. The detailed methodology for facilitating the Testing, Servicing, Repair and Calibration of vessels and PSVs at the mentioned sites was not found. 7. It was observed that additional two holes were created in HT-2 burner assembly to increase air flow, however no management of change (MOC) document was found. 8. PSV isolation valve was not provided at the HT 3 because of provision of regulation 111(6) of the Oil Mines Regulation (OMR) 2017 which stipulates that: ""There shall be no valve or fitting between the pressure apparatus and its pressure relieving safety device or between the device and the point of discharge, as would render the device ineffective."" 9. PSV test bench was set up in front of Heater treater shed under a tree. However, no approval for the same was found. 10. Installation has 15 nos. of CCTV installed to cover the gate & perimeter of the installation. 12 nos. of CCTV were working on the day of the incident. No CCTV coverage was available for the Heater treater area. As informed, all CCTV went out of operation at 15:02 hrs due to power fluctuations and could be restored at 16:55 hrs. It is noted that the plant was operational & other equipment was also running during this period, which casts doubt on the claim of CCTV outage due to power fluctuation. 11. HT area was installed with 6 nos. of fixed gas detectors. As per provision, only a local alarm and GGS gate alarm are sounded and no automatic plant shutdown or any other action is linked with gas detection. During the discussion at site, it was informed that the alarm of the hydrocarbon detector was activated prior to the fire incident. 12. A Cell phone (not intrinsically safe) was found lying in crude oil between HT 2 and HT3 which shows a practice of carrying non-intrinsically safe mobile inside installation/process area. 13. The following points of 10 safety rules of the company were not adhered: a. Work with a valid permit when required b. Ensure a safe system of work c. Do not use mobile phones in operational areas. As above, it appears that practice of following safety rules was missing, and it indicates lack of safety culture and inadequate risk perception at the installation. 14. A fan in burnt condition was found between HT2 and HT3. Its presence there could not be explained. REASON OF FAILURE / ROOT CAUSE This Case study is based on the Investigation report submitted by committee and published for information purpose only. This information should be evaluated to determine if it is applicable in your operations, to avoid recurrence of such incidents.1. Recycle Pump RC-1 was started without ensuring the installation of PSV (Pressure Safety Valve) on heater treater HT-3 which shows lack of safety culture and casual attitude towards critical jobs inside installation. 2. The recommendations of the JSA (Job Safety Analysis) were not followed. 3. Non-adherence to Permit to Work system, Standard operating procedure (SOP). 4. Non-adherence to Contract clause. 5. Management of Change (MOC) was not followed. 6. Non-adherence to safety rules of the Company. CONCLUSION The unfortunate incident was avoidable. It is seen from the observations that accident occurred due to failure of multiple barriers simultaneously as indicated in the root causes. RECOMMENDATIONS 1. Before starting any equipment, it should be ensured that the system is lined up. Safety culture and risk perception at the installation should be improved. 2. The work permit system & JSA should be followed for all the maintenance jobs in line with OISD- STD-105. Also Lock out Tag out (LOTO) permit should be followed for all electrical jobs. 3. Organization should ensure that: i. MVT records of contractual persons are available. ii. Valid Competency Certificates of the competent person(s) are available. iii. The detailed methodology for facilitating the Testing, Servicing, Repair and Calibration of vessels and PSVs at the mentioned sites is prepared. 4. All contractual workers and visitors should be provided with safety briefings prior to the entry inside the installation. 5. Organization should ensure compliance to contract clauses. There should be a person responsible for monitoring it. The person should be competent enough to monitor the job. 6. All modifications in the installation should be implemented after MOC. 7. Matter for incorporation of isolation valve before PSV should be taken up with the regulator. The same is followed in downstream oil & gas industry as per regulatory and OISD standard requirements. 8.

Oil Pipeline leakage Incident in an Offshore Pipeline,Offshore,02/05/2025,"CASE STUDY OISD/CS/2025-26/PL/03 Dt.: 02/05/2025 INTRODUCTION Title: Oil Pipeline leakage Incident in an Offshore Pipeline. Location: Offshore. Loss/ Outcome: Loss of crude oil. BRIEF OF INCIDENT Crude oil was being pumped in an offshore pipeline from two process platforms. Pressure at these process platforms was 28.51 kg/cm2 and 46.46 kg/cm2 respectively. At receiving end, pressure was 8.7 kg/cm2. Suddenly pressure drop was observed at both process platforms and receiving station of the pipeline. At process platforms pressure dropped to 3.76 kg/cm2 and 4.5 kg/cm2 respectively. At receiving station, pressure dropped to 1.5 kg/cm2. After receiving information about this sudden pressure drop, Inspection maintenance and repair department, mobilized two nearby vessels for leak survey. During leak survey, one of the vessels located oil sleek and bubbles at four locations. Remote operated vehicle (ROV) launched by the vessel located bubbles emanating from the pipeline at one subsea location. The coordinates of leak point were recorded and chainage of this leak location along pipeline from process platforms was found 18.955 KM. Figure No. 1 Subsequently pipeline was exposed and exact length of opening was established which was 1200 mm (Long) X 75mm (Maximum width). Seabed depth at this location was 81.0 meters Provided for information purpose only. This information should be evaluated to determine if it is applicable in your operations, to avoid recurrence of such incidents.sea water (msw). There was a gap of 0.5m between pipeline bottom and seabed, which might have developed due to rupture of pipeline. Pipeline was buried approximately 2.0 meter below seabed in the vicinity of leak location. Figure No. 2 OBSERVATIONS / CONTRADICTIONS Following observations were noted basis site visit, interaction with officials and checking of existing systems, procedures and documents: 1. Due to unavailability of crude oil in required quantity post commissioning and subsequent wax build up inside the pipeline, pigging and inline inspection were never carried out. It was repeatedly highlighted during external safety audit by OISD that Inline inspection and cleaning of pipeline by pigging was not done since its commissioning. It was also specifically stressed that in absence of integrity inspection since commissioning of pipeline, any major leak in pipeline will severely affect evacuation of crude. 2. As part of compliance to OISD observations, Magnetic Tomography (MTM) survey was carried out in 2020 which had concluded that there are 333 anomalies and safe operating pressure was found below the operating pressure of the pipeline. The report indicated 32 anomalies with immediate repair condition. The report also indicated probability of failure of pipeline if it continues to operate at current operating pressure. Alternately, pipeline may be operated at lower pressure, in the event of delay in repair activity being undertaken. However, action taken report for these recommendations were not found. 3. Another MTM survey was conducted in 2023. Report concluded 1388 anomalies with Estimated Repair Factor (ERF)>1, out of which, 1368 were in initial 40 KM section. Report mentioned that pipeline segment between 0 to 40.283 KM was not safe to continue operation under the current operating conditions. However, pipeline continued to be operated at same operating conditions. 4. Safety instrumentation system and respective interlocks to trip the crude oil pumps at respective platforms in case of abrupt pressure drop malfunctioned during pipeline leak. 5. Organization reported maximum volume of oil spill as 2.2225 KL calculated as per their oil spill contingency plan (OSCP) document. However, loss of crude as per difference between pumped and receipt quantity was 382 KL, which indicated significant variation with respect to calculated volume of crude as per OSCP document. Provided for information purpose only. This information should be evaluated to determine if it is applicable in your operations, to avoid recurrence of such incidents.REASONS OF FAILURE / ROOT CAUSE 1. Pipeline was continued to be operated above the safe operating pressure for more than one year after latest MTM survey report of December-2023. Immediate measures like bringing down the pressure in initial 40 KM section below safe pressure or reviewing Risk- 1 anomalies for any suitable mitigation were not taken. Though future corrective actions were discussed in key management meetings, neither any immediate mitigation measures were taken nor appropriate management approval was taken to operate the pipeline above the safe pressure. 2. Corrosion Inhibitor (CI) dosing rate was not adequate to ensure that corrosion rate is maintained below 1 MPY as per clause no. 5.10 of OISD-STD-188. RECOMMENDATIONS 1. Organization shall review the current operating pressure of pipeline from platforms considering recommendation of MTM report of Dec-23 for safe operation of the pipeline till alternate options are not fully functional. Either operating pressure may be reduced below safe pressure as per MTM report or Risk-1 categories anomalies may be evaluated for necessary mitigation for safe operation of the pipeline. 2. For all offshore pipelines, inspection shall be carried out as per OISD-STD-139. Wherever such inspections are not possible to be carried out due to operational or other constraints, management approval shall be taken. 3. Organization shall review the current corrosion inhibitor dosing rate in the pipeline and immediate corrective actions shall be taken to maintain the corrosion rate as per OISD- STD-188. 4. Organization shall reverify the estimated leak calculated under its OSCP guidelines with respect to actual loss of oil. 5. Organization shall review the existing periodic inspection schedule and maintenance system/ philosophy to ensure that safety critical equipment and interlocks do function during actual emergencies and necessary corrective actions shall be taken accordingly, if any. 6. Long-pending ESA recommendations shall be monitored at higher levels as per organization approved procedures. Gaps in roles, responsibilities and coordination among various departments of pipeline operation, maintenance and safety shall be reviewed and suitable corrective actions shall be taken. ============================== Provided for information purpose only.

Fatal accident during the laying down of Drill Pipe on Catwalk through V-door Location: Offshore Drilling Rig,Offshore Drilling Rig,,"CASE STUDY OISD/CS/2025-26/E&P/04 Dt.:02.06.2025 INTRODUCTION Title: Fatal accident during the laying down of Drill Pipe on Catwalk through V-door Location: Offshore Drilling Rig. Loss/ Outcome: Fatality of a floorman of the rig. BRIEF OF INCIDENT: A fatal accident took place near the V-door on the drill floor of an offshore chartered hired drilling rig. The incident occurred during the process of laying down 5-1/2” drill pipe singles onto the catwalk using a single joint elevator. The crew had completed laying down 16 joints of 5-1/2"" drill pipe. The injured person (IP, one of the floor men) pushed the 17th Drill Pipe from the mouse hole out towards the V-door. The pipe was pushed towards the inclined ramp. While the pipe was pushed on the ramp, it swung back and hit the V-door. The impact may have caused the safety pin (secondary retention) to fall out. The single joint elevator got unlatched, subsequently releasing the DP. The released drill pipe made contact with the IP before sliding down the V-door and coming to rest on the frame at the bottom of the catwalk. Upon noticing the incident, the Floormen and Tugger on the rig floor immediately stopped work and rushed to assess the situation. Unfortunately, they noticed that one floor man (IP) was severely injured, bleeding profusely from the nose, ear, and mouth. The IP was transferred to the base hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries. OBSERVATIONS/ SHORTCOMINGS 1. There was no evidence that Category II inspection was conducted, which was also recommended by OEM. As a result, critical deficiencies in the elevator went undetected: • Replacement of the OEM-supplied safety latch pin with a cotter pin. The latch spring was rusted and broken. • Undersized cotter pin (6 mm vs. OEM-recommended 14 mm) used. Though preventive maintenance records were provided, the elevator’s condition indicated that OEM maintenance and storage guidelines were not followed. 2. The Category III inspection reports had several critical deficiencies: • Failed to document dimensional checks and condition assessment of the safety latch pin. This Case study is based on the Investigation report submitted by committee and published for information purpose only. This information should be evaluated to determine if it is applicable in your operations, to avoid recurrence of such incidents.• Lacked bore diameter measurements across multiple sections- improper inspection and assessment. • One of the reports included a mismatched photograph not corresponding to the actual elevator. • Incorrectly identified the manufacturer name. None of these discrepancies were identified by OIM/ Authorized representative, suggesting a lack of practice or protocol for reviewing and verifying inspection report findings. 3. A system of reporting and documenting unsafe activities or conditions was available at the rig. However, this procedure was treated as a mere formality rather than being adopted with genuine intent. During the investigation, numerous unsafe conditions were observed on the rig floor, yet the crew did not report them and continued working despite the risks. 4. Safety committee meeting discussions were limited to statistics (e.g. number of unsafe activities or conditions received, number of meetings, etc). Important issues like equipment condition, unsafe acts, or near misses were not addressed or communicated to the crew. The Company Man did not attend safety committee meetings. 5. The visibility of the tugger was found to be obstructed due to the placement of materials on the rig. CONCLUSION / ROOT CAUSE The root cause of the fatal incident was the unlatching of the single joint (SJ) elevator, attributed to the following factors: 1. The use of the cotter pin in place of the OEM-supplied safety latch pin, which was undersized and loosely fitted, causing it to dislodge from the designated hole due to sudden impact on the V-door incline ramp. 2. The broken latch spring contributed to the unlatching of the elevator. 3. Failure to conduct Category II Inspection, which could have identified the critical deficiencies, such as broken latch spring and an undersized cotter pin in place of the safety latch pin. Inaccurate and incomplete Category III Inspections, where safety latch pin and bore diameter inspections were not documented or done inadequately. 4. Lack of safety culture where the crew did not report unsafe conditions and non-properly maintained equipment. 5. Responsible personnel at the installation failed to identify the poor condition of the SJ elevator, and other unsafe conditions, and took timely corrective action. Their inaction allowed the continued operation of defective equipment, despite clear signs of deficiencies. RECOMMENDATIONS 1. Daily Category II inspections must be conducted as per OEM Recommendations /API RP 8B. Inspection parties should be selected with due diligence and reports must be cross verified by competent rig officials to ensure quality and accuracy. 2. Maintenance activities, including lubrication and greasing of critical components, must adhere to OEM manuals. Equipment storage should follow OEM procedures to maintain integrity during non-use. 3. Rig materials must be positioned to avoid obstructing the tugger or driller's line of sight. CCTV coverage should provide a 360-degree view for enhanced situational awareness. This Case study is based on the Investigation report submitted by committee and published for information purpose only. This information should be evaluated to determine if it is applicable in your operations, to avoid recurrence of such incidents.4. A positive safety culture must be promoted, encouraging reporting of unsafe acts/conditions and prompt action. Individuals should adhere to safety values in daily operations. 5. A structured induction and orientation program should be made mandatory for all personnel, including Company Man, prior to their deployment on offshore installations as per the requirement of clause 7.2 of “Report of the working group on safety in Indian petroleum sector-2023”. 6. Safety Committee meetings should address significant HSE issues, beyond procedural formalities, with clear actions and responsibilities communicated to the crew. 7. The Internal Safety Audits should be carried out by the operator (including chartered hired rigs) each year through a multidisciplinary team. 8. The company should develop a safety rating system to monitor the safety performance of the contractors as per clause 7.3.2 of the Working Group Committee Report. 9. To mitigate the risk of incidents similar to the one observed, the following measures, as highlighted in the International Journals on Accidents involving single joint elevators, may be adopted: • Locking pins designed to remain fixed within the tool’s body should be used, eliminating the need for additional retention methods such as chains, thereby enhancing reliability and safety. • Locking pins with a positive latch mechanism should be used that includes visual confirmation, ensuring that when the activator pin is fully extended, the pins are securely engaged and locked, providing a clear and reliable indicator of proper securing.

BRIEF OF INCIDENT: A fire incident occurred in an off-gas compressor within a gas processing facility. Prior to the incident, maintenance personnel, engaged in some other job in the area, noticed unusual vibrations and abnormal noise emanating from the off-gas compressor. On closer inspection, they observed gas leakage from the compressor and asked others to clear the site before rushing off. Subsequently, a loud sound was heard followed by a fire outbreak in the compressor area. The fire was extinguished in about 55 minutes with no casualties reported. The compressor was around 50 years old. It was a multi-stage 5-cylinder reciprocating compressor. In the recent past a few modifications had been carried out in suction/ discharge volume bottles of the compressor and minor overhaul had been carried out. 1"" drain line from the weld joint connected to the 2nd stage discharge volume bottle of the compressor snapped OBSERVATIONS / LAPSES at the weld joint This Case Study is based on the Investigation report done by OISD and published for information purpose only.
